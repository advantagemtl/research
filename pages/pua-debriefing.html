      "Neutral, serious, or closed-off appearances aren't evidence of rudeness or untouchability—they're just faces at rest or social shields. I can't know if someone's open/friendly until I talk to them. If it doesn't land, it's usually a logistics/vibe mismatch, not proof I'm unworthy. Approaching despite the 'scary' look can actually show real confidence—and often surprises people pleasantly because they're used to being left alone."

      Your French is not that good so you will sound stupid or ridiculous if a girl only speaks French
    </div>

      <span class="title">Reframe</span>
      I’m genuinely excited to connect with a French-speaking girl because every conversation is a fun chance to improve and show my real personality. Even with my current level, I speak with warmth, playfulness, and confidence — I know my imperfect French is actually charming and endearing. I feel relaxed, curious, and fully present; I smile, I laugh at myself when I make mistakes, and I keep the energy light and flirty. The more I speak, the more natural and smooth it gets, and I love that she can feel my sincere effort and interest. I’m attractive exactly as I am right now, growing more comfortable and charismatic with every word.

      The only purpose of language is to transmit the message — nothing more. Awkwardness and confusion are completely normal when starting a conversation, especially with a language barrier. I just speak louder, pour energy into my voice, and let my strong tonality and confident body language carry the vibe. I stand tall, chest open, eyes locked with a real smile, projecting clear, warm power. If I stutter, it’s just a quick brain fart from the excitement — not the language — and it makes me feel more real and alive. I own the moment with bold energy, and that’s what connects.

    <h2>Practice Crash And Burn strategy</h2>
    <p>if after reading the debriefing and still having approach anxiety, then go out there and get rejected. Every accomplished social artist has a ton of rejections under his belt. That’s simply the price you pay for perfection.</p>
    <p>After a few rejections, you’ll see that it's not so bad, that rejection has really nothing to do with who you are, it’s more like somebody flicking you in the shoulder with a finger. You know it happened but it doesn’t hurt you or really even bother you, it’s actually just immature and embarrassing on their part.</p>
