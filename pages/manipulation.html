    <h1>Manipulation and gaslighting.</h1>


    <p>
        A person turns to psychology in order to know himself and better understand his loved ones. <br />
        Such knowledge is essential in seeing and realizing true motives of their actions
        Dark psychology, however, just focuses on the kinds of thoughts and actions that are predatory in nature.<br />
        Dark psychology examines the tactics used by malicious people to motivate, persuade,
        manipulate, or coerce others into acting in ways that are beneficial to themselves,
        and potentially detrimental to the other person.<br />
        Dark psychology is rooted in 4 dark personality traits. These traits are; narcissism, Machiavellianism,
        psychopathy, and sadism.<br />
        People with such traits tend to act in ways that are pointlessly harmful to others.<br />
        the victim of dark psychological influence simply could not find an explanation for what happened.<br />
        As has been noted more than once, the specifics of dark psychology makes the active user “process” the client in
        a roundabout way.<br />
        He does not give direct commands to do this or that but encourages a person to do it as if he
        is acting on his own initiative.
        <br />The person comments, asks, consults and - gets his way.

        Behind his behavior is a certain strategy. <br />
        One of them is speculation. The phrase stands in such a way that some
        phenomenon, action or object is presented in it as if it was actually accepted. For example, they ask you: “Will
        you pay in dollars or bitcoins?” The question is innocent, but you have not yet said that you intend to purchase
        this thing at all.<br />
        The question assumes that you have already made such a decision and it remains to solve the
        trifle - to pay in bitcoins or dollars, about which you begin to reflect. <br />
        The essence of this technique is as follows: the dark psychologist makes up the text of the suggestion,
        and then “dissolves” it in a story of neutral content. <br />During the conversation, the “user” in some way
        selects
        the words
        of suggestion and they turn out to be a brilliant trap for consciousness.<br /> He (or she) will change the
        volume of
        speech, pause
        in characteristic places, speed up or slow down the story. <br />
        The dark triad is nothing more than an identification system for the three
        most destructive and harmful psychological personality traits a person can have. <br />
        This chapter will take some time to detail each of the traits, including narcissism, psychopathy, and
        Machiavellianism. <br />
        Let’s take a look at each part and see what it means when it comes to dark psychology. <br />
        What Is Machiavellianism?

        The first aspect of the Dark Triad that we will discuss is known as Machiavellianism.<br /> This aspect gets its
        name
        from the political philosopher known as Machiavelli. <br />In his classical work “The Prince,” the ideas,
        principles,
        and tactics that are used by those who seek to influence others are outlined. <br />But how exactly does a
        Machiavellian person come across?

        The hallmarks of this trait include a willingness to focus on your self-interest all the time, an understanding
        of the importance of your image, the perception of appearance, and even the ruthless exercise of power and
        cruelty rather than using mercy or compassion.<br />

        To keep it simple, people who have this trait are ones who always have a strategy when they approach life.
        <br />The
        consequences and any ramifications about any action are going to be thought out and then assessed in terms of
        how they are going to impact the one who is carrying them out.<br /> The Machiavellian approach to the world is
        summed
        up with a
        simple question: “How will this action benefit me, and how will my public perception be impacted as a result?”

        Machiavellian people are going to be masters of doing what is going to personally serve them well, while still
        being able to maintain the good public image that they want.<br /> This allows the manipulator to do what they
        want,
        while still getting people around them to still like them.<br />


        What Is Psychopathy?

        The net aspect that we can discuss is psychopathy. <br />This is going to refer to a psychological condition
        that
        involves a superficial charm, impulsivity, and a lack of commonly held human emotions, such as remorse and
        empathy. <br />Someone who exhibits enough of these traits can be known as a psychopath.<br /> These individuals
        are seen as
        some of the most dangerous people because they are able to hide their true intentions, while still causing a lot
        of trouble.<br />

        People often associate the word “psychopath” with an image of someone who is mad and wields a machete.<br /> The
        reality is different, and this can make it more deadly.<br /> A true psychopath is more likely to be that
        charming and
        handsome stranger who is able to win over their victim before they ruin those victims’ lives in the
        process.<br />

        Interestingly, some of the top people in business score high on psychopathy personality tests.<br /> But as time
        goes
        on, it is becoming more common to see psychopathy as more of a problem to the victim and to society rather than
        an issue in the psychopath’s own life. <br />Psychopaths are able to get to the top of anything that they choose
        because they don’t have to worry about some of the compassionate indecision that other humans are going to
        experience.<br />

        What Is Narcissism?

        The third aspect of the Dark Triad that we need to explore is narcissism. <br />This is often thought of as the
        idea
        that a person loves themselves too much.<br /> This is close but quite the right definition for someone who is a
        narcissist. <br />You can have self-love without being considered a narcissist.<br />

        Someone who is considered a narcissist is likely to have a range of traits that are there.<br />They will have
        an
        excessively inflated self-worth, such as seeing that their life is extra special and one of the most important
        lives in all of history. <br />If this has been inflated enough, they may see that they are the very most
        important in
        the whole world.<br />

        In the mind of a narcissist, they are not only special, but they are superior to everyone else.<br /> They
        consider
        themselves to be a better species of person, higher than what normal people would be.<br /> And because a
        narcissist
        believes this way, their behaviors are going to change.<br /> The behavior that you see in a narcissist is going
        to
        reflect the self-worth that the person has.<br />

        Some of the outward signs or manifestations of this aspect would include the inability of the person to accept
        any dissent or criticism of any kind. <br />Even if they feel that someone is trying to criticize them, they are
        going
        to have a hard time dealing with this.<br /> This kind of person also feels the need to have others agree with
        them
        all the time and they like to be flattered. <br />If you are around someone who seems to always have a need for
        constant praise, recognition, and approval, and if they seem to organize their lives in order to give them
        constant access to those who will fill this need, then it is likely that you are dealing with someone who is a
        narcissist.<br />

        These three aspects are going to come together to form the Dark Triad.<br /> When one person has all of these
        three
        traits in them, it can be a hard task to stay away and not get pulled into whatever plan they have.<br /> Being
        on the
        lookout for these can make a big difference in how much control you have in your own personal life.<br />


        1) If you want to sell your product and wish to manipulate your customers to make them surely buy your product,
        you can use a decoy option. <br />You can use it as the third option. <br />For example, if you are facing a
        troublesome
        situation to sell the more expensive of two products, by adding the third option you can make the expensive
        product more captivating and appealing. <br />You just need to make sure that decoy option should be the same
        price
        for the more expensive option but assuring that it is less effective. <br />It is a good strategy to increase
        the sale
        and enticing more customers towards your expensive product.<br />

        2) To win an argument, speak quickly so that the opponent has no other option left but to agree with you.<br />
        If you
        speak faster, it will give the other person the less time to process what you are saying and they will agree
        with you. <br />While you should do the opposite in case when the other person agrees with you, speaking slowly
        is
        better as it will give them the time to evaluate and analyze what you are saying.<br />

        3) You can copy the body language of people whom you want to manipulate. <br />Imitating their body actions
        shall
        impress them and will make you closer to them and they may start liking you. <br />If you subtly imitate the way
        the
        other person is talking, sitting, and walking, they would probably not notice that you are copying them and it
        may get them to do as per your wants.<br />

        4) Scaring the other people to make them give you what you want and need is one of the dark psychological
        tactics to manipulate people.<br /> Anxious people often respond positively to requests afterward as they may be
        occupied thinking about the danger they are surrounded with. <br />It would make them feel scared and would do
        as your
        saying.<br /> In addition, sometimes, even if you will not say anything they will understand what you need and
        do what
        you would have spoken them to do for you.<br />

        5) To get people to behave ethically with you, you need to display an image of eyes.<br /> It means you should
        create
        your image as a person who watches, notice and observe the other person by posting a picture of eyes nearby.
        <br />The
        other people could never take you like a side option and will return all borrowed items on time.<br />

        6) Tweak such an environment for the people so that they would act less selfish.<br /> For example, if you were
        bargaining in a coffee shop, needless to say, you would be less aggressive as compared to what you would be in a
        conference room.<br /> Usually, people tend to act less selfish when neutral items surround them, whereas if
        work-related objects occupy them, they incline towards more aggression and selfishness.<br />

        7) Try to keep your point complicated and do not make it very easy for the people to understand in a first
        move.<br />
        To comply with people with your request, confuse them. <br />For example- instead of keeping a price tag of your
        product for 4 dollars, make it 400 pennies, so that people would first analyze how much dollars would 400
        pennies make and if they bargain they will do that in pennies rather than in dollars. <br />Or they may just
        think
        that the price given is a deal to go for.<br />

        8) If you help someone to achieve their goals or sort their problems out, the other person tends to return your
        favor, as they would feel obliged by what you have done for them. <br />This way when the time comes, you may
        manipulate the other person and is one of the tactics.<br />

        9) Try to ask a question or request a person at a time when they are mentally drained and exhausted. <br />They
        would
        never question the request or the chances of denial for your request are very less.<br />

        10) Always make the other person focus on their gaining not losing.<br /> Moreover, declare the price of your
        product
        at last after telling all the features and benefits of your product. <br />For instance, if you are selling your
        car
        in 1000 dollars, always let the other person know about its features, specifications, and benefits first.<br />
        Then
        declare its price. <br />The benefits will entice the customer towards the car, and then the price shall not be
        a
        constraint.<br />

        11) Do not use verbs; try to use more nouns to change the behavior of the other person towards you. <br />If you
        use
        nouns, it will reinforce the identity of the person for whom you may be using it. <br />It will also indicate a
        specific group which shall be eloquent.<br />

        Chapter 3: Analyzing People through Body Language
        Body Language Clues: The Basics

        When you try to know more about your goal and how they view the world, body language is going to be so
        crucial.<br />
        Too many times we get caught in the words that someone else tells us and we won't concentrate on the other
        indications they also give us. <br />There is so much that can be disclosed by these body language clues, and it
        makes
        a large difference how effective you are in understanding and working with your goals.<br />

        Body language will refer to some of the nonverbal signals we use to interact with others.<br /> These nonverbal
        signals will take up much of the interaction we communicate every day. <br />From the movement of our body to
        our
        facial expressions and everything in between, things we don't say can still share a ton of information during
        the process.<br /> Indeed, 60 to 65% of our interaction could be accounted for by body language and other
        nonverbal
        communications. <br />So how do we learn to read this language to our own advantage? Let's begin by learning
        more
        about the various indications of body language, and how we can read this for our benefit. <br />First off we
        have the
        facial expressions.<br />

        Think of a time, by the expression on your face, about how much data someone can convey. <br />A smile is a nice
        way
        to show happiness or consent. <br />A frown can imply the other way around.<br /> In some instances, facial
        expressions can
        show our real emotions about a scenario.<br /> While an individual may say he's okay, he looks like he's talking
        when
        he says this might talk otherwise. <br />There are many feelings on our facial expressions, including:<br />

        1. Contempt<br />

        2. Desire<br />

        3. Excitement<br />

        4. Confusion<br />

        5. Fear<br />

        The expression that appears on the person's face helps us to determine if we trust and think anything the person
        says.<br />In reality, one research discovered that the most credible of all facial expressions will be a small
        eyebrow raise and a slight smile.<br /> This is an expression that in many instances shows us to trust and
        friendliness.<br />

        The other type of body language cue will have to be the mouth.<br /> Mouth expressions and motions can be
        another
        vital component of body language reading.<br /> For instance, if you notice someone else chewing on his bottom
        lip, it
        may show that there are feelings of insecurity, fear, and worry. <br />The individual can cover his mouth to be
        polite
        when he coughs, but sometimes the other person's disapproval.<br /> And smiling will be one of the best signals
        of
        corporeal language, but the smile and what it says about a person can be evaluated differently. <br />Some of
        the
        stuff you can care about when reading someone else's mouth movements include;

        Pursed lips: If you see your goal tightened up, it's a sign of distrust, disagreement, and disgust.<br />
        Lip biting: This is when you bite your lower lip, usually when you are stressed, anxious, or distressed. <br />
        Mouth cover: Any moment someone wishes to conceal one of their emotional responses, they can cover their mouths
        in order to assist. <br />
        Turned up or down: Even a slight shift in your mouth can be a subtle indication of how you feel right now.
        <br />When your mouth turns up, it's a sign that you are hopeful or glad. <br />It could be a grimace,
        disagreement,
        and even sorrow when the mouth turns down.<br />
        Another area to observe as body language cue is gestures. <br />Gestures can be a very evident, direct sign of
        body language to be careful about.<br /> Waiving, pointing and fingering can be common and easy to understand
        gestures. <br />Some may even be cultural.<br /> Some of the most popular gestures and the significances that
        come with them
        include:<br />

        A clung fist: In most cases, this will show anger, but sometimes it can also imply solidarity.<br />
        Up or down thumbs: This is used as a sign of approval and disapproval.<br />
        The 'all correct' gesture: This one will assist others to say you're fine in the United States. <br />But it is
        seen
        in some other cultures as a vulgar gesture.<br />
        The next thing we have to do is look at the arms and legs of the individual you talk to.<br /> These can be
        useful if
        a lot of information is to be transmitted nonverbally. <br />Crossing the weapons will often be a defensive
        maneuver.<br />
        Crossing the legs away from another individual will also show a person's discomfort or a dislike.<br />

        Other subtle signals, including the large expansion of the arm, can sometimes help us to seem bigger and more
        comfortable while maintaining the arms close to the body.<br /> When you try to measure your body language a
        little,
        be careful about some of the following signals that your legs and arms will transmit to you from the target:

        Crossed arms: This will give you a signal that you're closed, safe and defensive.<br /> As a manipulator, you
        need to
        uncross the arms of the goal to make you feel comfortable.<br />
        Standing on hips with your hands: This can be a good sign that the person is ready and controlled. <br />This
        will
        sometimes be a sign of aggression.<br />
        Clamp the hands so that they're behind the back: This will be a sign that your goal is angry, anxious or
        boring.<br />
        You have to look at some of the other signals that come first.<br />
        Tap fingers or fidgeting quickly: The other person is frustrated, impatient and even bored.<br />
        Crossed legs: This is a good indication that someone feels closed or needs some privacy.<br />
        Posture is another thing you should look at. <br />The way we hold our bodies will also be a significant
        component of
        body language. <br />Posture refers to the way we hold our bodies and to a person's general physical
        shape.<br /> Posture
        can give a wealth of data on how someone feels and also suggests that a person's features are submissive, open
        or confident.<br />

        For instance, if you sit directly, it can show that an individual is concentrated and is attempting to look
        after what is going on.<br />Sitting down with the body, on the other side, will show that someone is most of
        the
        time indifferent or bored. <br />Looking at your goal will assist you to understand whether you are interested
        in what
        you do or say, or if you need to move on to find a different destination.<br />

        Whenever you attempt to read some of the languages of your body, attempt and find out some signals that your
        goal's position is attempting to tell you.<br /> Some of them are:

        Open posture. <br />Open posture.<br /> This includes keeping the body's trunk exposed and open.<br />
        Closed position: this one will require hiding the body's trunk and hitting the legs and arms. <br />This posture
        will
        be more indicative of anxiety, discomfort, and depression in the objective.<br />


        Emotional intelligence is psychological, where one understands and handles any kind of emotion with ease while
        remaining calm.<br />

        Emotional intelligence also referred to as emotional leadership or emotional quotient, is the ability of certain
        people to realize their emotions, as well as those of others, differentiate them, label, and readily manage or
        adjust depending on the situation or environment. <br />These people typically remain calm despite the changes
        in the
        surrounding or negative impacts associated with a given case. <br />Besides, they may apply the capability to
        help
        those affected by awkward feelings, therefore, making them feel at peace.<br /> Emotional intelligence is
        psychological, where one understands and handles any kind of emotion with ease while remaining calm.<br />

        Over the years, the definition of emotional intelligence was broken down into four sections: perceiving,
        utilizing, learning, and managing. <br />The four abilities were all attributed to emotional intelligence with
        relative meanings behind them.<br /> Different models were created using these abilities, therefore,
        facilitating how
        thoughts and understanding of emotions interact.<br /> Studies show that people with more emotional intelligence
        tend
        to succeed more in various areas, including academics, careers, and talents. <br />The ability has also been
        associated with providing great leadership and higher performance at work. <br />More so, researchers agree that
        these
        people are healthy mentally as well as on their standard personality traits.<br />

        Since the introduction of emotional intelligence, different studies have been conducted with the objective of
        determining the actual factors driving an individual to manage emotions. <br />Most of us react to varying
        feelings to
        some extent, depending on the severity or fun in it. <br />However, higher emotional intelligence people have
        the
        ability to manage these emotions and have a minimal impact on their lives, even on extensive influences of a
        situation.<br /> With different groups of people, emotional intelligence has been seen to have different
        implications
        on the thoughts of these individuals.<br /> For instance, children and teens with high emotional intelligence
        tend to
        have good social interaction while those having lower abilities have the opposite. <br />Adults with high
        emotional
        intelligence accompany an excellent self-perception socially while those with low emotional intelligence tend to
        become aggressive.<br />

        Features of Emotional Intelligence<br />

        Show of Authenticity<br />

        High emotional intelligence people, especially those who are more social, tend to stick to their principles and
        values. <br />When sharing about themselves to others, they usually stand by their boundaries rather than
        sharing
        everything about themselves to others. <br />As such, authenticity does not imply that you have to share all
        about
        yourself.<br /> However, you share about yourself to people who matter and those who understand you and
        appreciate
        your thoughts and feelings.<br />

        Demonstration of Empathy<br />

        These individuals tend to demonstrate empathy to people as they readily understand other people’s feelings and
        thoughts.<br /> They, therefore, readily connect to others and agree on what is essential.<br /> Emotional
        intelligence
        enables them to develop more profound and more productive relationships with others.<br /> Instead of becoming
        judgmental and avoiding those who feel different, they comfort and make them feel important to society.<br />
        Despite
        being empathetic, these people are cautious when it comes to decision making, therefore avoiding agreeing to
        every person's motive.<br />

        Apologetic and Forgiving<br />

        Another feature of emotional intelligence people is that they quickly understand their mistakes.<br /> They
        usually
        have the courage and strength to apologize even without errors, therefore, indicating value to a
        relationship.<br />
        The same applies to forgive and forget, even in the most resentful situations.<br /> As such, having emotional
        intelligence provides a mind that readily forgives and free from your emotions from those who hurt you.<br />

        Being Helpful<br />

        As emotional intelligence entails understanding and managing your emotions and that of others, then helping them
        becomes part of what the ability accompanies. <br />As one of the most significant rewards to others, helping
        becomes
        a habit to these people, and they never tire or discriminate against others. <br />However, they help each
        person in
        need without asking too many questions. <br />As such, it helps those who follow similar footsteps as well as
        building
        trust among people to help others.<br />

        Always Thinking About Feelings<br />

        Emotional intelligence primarily dwells on one's feelings which often change suddenly or slowly depending on the
        situation or environment.<br /> When an individual has a higher emotional intelligence capability, then he or
        she
        frequently thinks about different feelings and how it may impact others. <br />They usually ask about common
        questions
        regarding their self-awareness, reflecting on everyday activities, and people who may be influenced by their
        emotions.<br /> As such, systematic thinking and learning about emotions provide insights used to their
        advantage in
        managing their feelings and that of others.<br />

        Benefit from Criticism<br />

        Nobody experiences fun when it comes to negative feedback, especially from people you trust and those close to
        you. <br />However, these types of reputation are quite effective in life as they teach you a few lessons about
        a
        particular aspect. <br />Besides, it enables you to learn more about how others think mainly about you and
        things to
        change and become better in what you do. <br />Receiving these negative feedbacks may become a challenge to
        others,
        but those with the ability to check their emotions benefit a lot. <br />With the use of emotional intelligence,
        these
        people can learn to manage their emotions and move around calmly without focusing on the thoughts of
        others.<br />

        Managing Emotions<br />

        People with Low Emotional Intelligence<br />

        When low emotional intelligence people are faced with any negative emotion, they tend to become violent or
        rather more reactive when compared to those with high emotional intelligence. <br />For instance, when an
        individual
        with low emotional intelligence faces negative criticism, they may initially go into denial and withdraw from a
        given group to avoid shame.<br /> They become lonely and prevent any form of help offered towards them. <br />In
        some cases,
        others may opt to use substances to keep their minds active and evade others and what they are feeling.
        <br />Others
        may harm themselves by cutting, starving, purging, or engaging in dangerous behaviors. <br />The primary drive
        to
        these activities is influenced by a lack of control of emotions which are usually hurting, such as
        criticism.<br />


        more profound and more productive relationships with others. <br />Instead of becoming judgmental and avoiding
        those
        who feel different, they comfort and make them feel important to society. <br />Despite being empathetic, these
        people
        are cautious when it comes to decision making, therefore avoiding agreeing to every person's motive.<br />

        Apologetic and Forgiving<br />

        Another feature of emotional intelligence people is that they quickly understand their mistakes. <br />They
        usually
        have the courage and strength to apologize even without errors, therefore, indicating value to a
        relationship.<br />
        The same applies to forgive and forget, even in the most resentful situations. <br />As such, having emotional
        intelligence provides a mind that readily forgives and free from your emotions from those who hurt you.<br />

        Being Helpful<br />

        As emotional intelligence entails understanding and managing your emotions and that of others, then helping them
        becomes part of what the ability accompanies.<br /> As one of the most significant rewards to others, helping
        becomes
        a habit to these people, and they never tire or discriminate against others. <br />However, they help each
        person in
        need without asking too many questions.<br /> As such, it helps those who follow similar footsteps as well as
        building
        trust among people to help others.<br />

        Managing Emotions<br />

        People with Low Emotional Intelligence<br />

        When low emotional intelligence people are faced with any negative emotion, they tend to become violent or
        rather more reactive when compared to those with high emotional intelligence. <br />For instance, when an
        individual
        with low emotional intelligence faces negative criticism, they may initially go into denial and withdraw from a

        to
        these activities is influenced by a lack of control of emotions which are usually hurting, such as
        criticism.<br />

        People with High Emotional Intelligence<br />

        High emotional intelligence people have all it takes to absorb and express reasonably about how they feel about
        a particular sensation.<br /> For instance, when these group people are offended, they would initially pause
        before
        acting and think what their next word or rather the best harmless action to take.<br /> They would also
        acknowledge
        what the next person is feeling or have in mind before deciding on providing their contribution or conclusion of
        what will become.<br /> Thinking first is usually their first step to prevent escalating the problem or causing
        more
        harm to themselves and others. <br />Another critical aspect of high emotional intelligence people is helping
        themselves and people affected by a given emotion. <br />In this case, high emotional intelligence people act
        entirely
        different when compared to low emotional intelligence individuals.<br />


        Self-Awareness

        This is the ability to recognize and learn about your emotions as well as understanding the effects accompanied
        by your feelings.<br /> Becoming self-aware is determined by being able to monitor emotions, realizing emotional
        reactions, and identifying each emotion independently.<br /> Besides, you readily understand and figure out the
        interaction between your emotions and how you behave when that feeling occurs.<br /> That is, when you are an
        emotionally intelligent individual, you become aware of several aspects about yourself and others while keeping
        in mind about what is wrong and right.<br /> You can readily make a choice to do wrong or wicked despite how
        sad,
        angry, or hopeless you become.<br />

        More Emotional People <br />

        More emotional people tend to have low emotional intelligence and therefore, become very reactive, especially on
        negative emotions.<br /> In this case, these people usually lack self-awareness, self-regulation, and other
        components
        of emotional intelligence.<br /> When someone is regarded as a more sensitive person, the chances are that they
        may
        become very reactive on occasions such as anger and become violent.<br /> When sad, they may end up becoming
        stressed,
        lonely, and eventually, being depressed.<br /> This group of people may, however, have some ability to control
        some of
        their emotions but limited knowledge about how they react to a given situation.<br />

        More emotional people may, at times, face difficulties on how they interact publicly, henceforth, cannot sustain
        relationships.<br /> Some of the characteristic features of more emotional people include the inability to
        understand
        other people’s emotions, getting into arguments quickly, blaming others for their mistakes, and lack of
        empathy.<br />
        Other features include difficulty sustaining friends, sudden outbursts of emotions, refusal to listen to other's
        views, and thinking people are usually oversensitive.<br /> More emotional people typically have no control over
        how
        they express their feelings or emotions.<br /> Therefore, they become too dependent on themselves without
        minding
        others.<br />

        Less Emotional People <br />

        Less emotional people are those individuals with the ability to control their emotions or feelings even when
        they are profound or negative. <br />These individuals usually have a much higher emotional intelligence when
        compared
        to more emotional people. <br />As highlighted above, less emotional people have the ability to suppress their
        emotions even in the states where these emotions seem unbearable.<br /> They may look calm and in peace even
        after a
        hurtful event.<br /> More so, they are relaxed and understanding and interact well with the general public,
        mainly
        with friends, family, and those close to them, such as coworkers.<br />

        When in an emotional state, for instance, these individuals typically respond to issues rather than react and
        understand the matter at hand.<br /> They are equipped with the five components of emotional intelligence as
        well as
        self-control and handle situations with their related selves. <br />When faced with a more challenging
        situation, less
        emotional people rarely complain but work to find ways of solving the problem, which, in most cases, succeed
        with limited failure possibilities.<br /> As typical human beings, however, less emotional people also undergo
        similar
        impacts of negative emotions, but due to their emotional intelligence abilities, they readily get in control of
        their feelings and find ways to handle these situations without causing scenes.<br />


        Chapter 7: Mind Control Techniques<br />
        It’s interesting to see that manipulation has been around for a long time, and that is not a new or imaginary
        concept. <br />Understanding what the art of persuasion is really all about is vital, to help you to deal with
        it.<br />

        Here, we briefly look at the psychology of manipulation.<br /> This allows us to see where it might occur in our
        lives. <br />It will also help you in identifying those who might attempt to manipulate you.<br /> It is not
        only about
        people who like to dominate.<br /> If we don't know it is happening to us, might be encouraged to act in ways
        that are
        incongruous to our normal personality and behavior.<br /> Learn how commerce can persuade customers into buying
        their
        goods and services.<br /> Recognizing such methods will help in dealing with the power of persuasion.<br />

        We like to believe that we are individuals who make sensible choices.<br /> In our personal journey of life, we
        do not
        always have full control, and we don't always realize this.<br /> As children, we are influenced by our parents
        and
        have little control over how we are raised.<br /> Once in the education system, we are further
        manipulated.<br /> The
        teachers will tell us all about the social norms and what is expected of us in society.<br /> As adults, we are
        lured
        in by politicians trying to get their share of votes.<br /> Many are persuaded to vote for a party because of
        what
        they promise for the future, even if they don’t necessarily believe in their policies.<br /> This gives such
        politicians power, and their decisions will affect our lives. <br />Are we in full control of our lives, or are
        we
        merely influenced by those who know all the tricks of persuasion?<br />



        Persuasive Language<br />

        The idiom that every picture tells a story is very true. <br />Words can be so much more powerful a s they
        inspire and
        encourage us, even to the point of manipulation.<br /> How many are the times you have been inspired by a good
        orator,
        whose daring speech motives you into action? Words even influence when we are lost completely in a great
        book.<br />
        The art of words can be so influential in coercing us to believe something, even when our eyes tell us
        differently.<br /> Communication is a powerful tool, especially when it comes to making people do things.<br />

        Advertisers and salespeople use language to convince their goods are just what we are looking for.<br /> Using
        words,
        such as:
        Affordable;<br /> Easy to use; <br />Safe;<br /> Enjoyable;<br /> Time Saving; Guaranteed to last.<br />

        Note how all these words make us believe they are confident in their own products.<br />

        Politicians will use language, such as:<br />
        “We” - to encompass you in their world.<br />

        “Us” to make you feel a part of a team.<br />

        These are all communication tactics to make us feel included, so therefore important.<br />

        Bullies use language along with aggressive behavior, to achieve their own selfish goals.<br />
        Criminal predators, such as psychopaths, sociopaths and narcissists, are all people who learn the use of
        persuasive language.<br /> This is a means to get their own way and gain control over another person.<br />


        Prescient Programming is a subtle manipulation tactic where someone prepares your mind to react a certain way
        before an event even happens. <br />It’s like emotional sabotage in advance — shaping your interpretation
        instead of
        your choice. <br />For example, a manipulator might say, “You’ll probably get upset, but I’m just being honest,”
        or “I
        know you’ll understand once you calm down.<br />” These statements quietly redefine future emotions as
        overreactions
        or agreement.<br /> When the moment arrives, you hesitate to trust your instincts because the script has already
        been
        written for you.<br />


        How to Recognize and Neutralize It:<br />
        When someone keeps predicting how you’ll feel or act, pause and ask yourself whether that forecast matches your
        reality.<br /> A useful test is to rephrase the moment in your own words—“I feel frustrated, not overreactive,”
        or
        “I’m calm, but I still disagree.<br />” Naming your emotion breaks the pre‑loaded frame and restores
        perspective.<br /> Look
        for repeated cues such as “You’ll see later,” “You always…,” or “I knew you’d say that.<br />” These are signs
        of a
        pre‑written narrative.<br /> Step back, breathe, and decide what the situation means to you instead of playing
        the
        role someone assigned.<br />



        Techniques Used in Mind Control

        Present day mind control is both innovative and mental. <br /> Tests demonstrate that basically by uncovering
        the
        techniques for mind control, the impacts can be diminished or disposed of, at any rate for mind control
        publicizing and promulgation.<br /> Increasingly hard to counter are the physical interruptions, which the
        military-mechanical complex keeps on creating and enhance.<br />

        Education — This is the most self-evident, yet still remains the most treacherous. <br /> It has consistently
        been an
        eventual tyrant's definitive dream to 'teach' normally receptive youngsters, subsequently it has been a focal
        segment to Communist and Fascist oppressive regimes from the beginning of time.<br /> Nobody has been
        increasingly
        instrumental in uncovering the motivation of present day instruction than Charlotte Iserbyt — one can start
        investigation into this region by downloading a her book as a free PDF, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America,
        revealing the job of Globalist establishments in forming a future planned to deliver servile automatons reigned
        over by a completely taught, mindful exclusive class.<br />
        Promotions and Propaganda – Edward Bernays has been referred to as the creator of the consumerist culture that
        was planned principally to focus on individuals' mental self-portrait (or scarcity in that department) so as to
        transform a need into a need.<br /> This was at first imagined for items, for example, cigarettes, for
        instance.<br />
        Nonetheless, Bernays additionally noted in his 1928 book, Propaganda, that 'purposeful publicity is the official
        arm of the imperceptible government.<br /> ' This can be seen most unmistakably in the advanced police state and
        the
        developing native nark culture, enveloped with the pseudo-enthusiastic War on Terror. <br /> The expanding union
        of
        media has empowered the whole corporate structure to converge with government, which currently uses the idea of
        promulgation arrangement.<br /> Media; print, motion pictures, TV, and link news would now be able to work
        flawlessly
        to incorporate a general message which appears to have the ring of truth since it originates from such a
        significant number of sources, at the same time. <br /> When one moves toward becoming sensitive to recognizing
        the
        fundamental 'message,' one will see this engraving all over.<br /> What's more, this isn't even to specify
        subliminal
        informing.<br />
        Prescient Programming – Many still deny that prescient writing computer programs is genuine.<br /> Prescient
        programming has its causes in predominately elitist Hollywood, where the big screen can offer a major vision of
        where society is going.<br /> Simply glance back at the books and motion pictures which you thought were
        implausible,
        or 'sci-fi' and investigate society today. <br /> For a nitty gritty breakdown of explicit models, Vigilant
        Citizen is
        an incredible asset that will most likely make you take a gander at 'amusement' in a totally unique light.<br />
        Sports, Politics, Religion – Some may resent seeing religion, or even legislative issues, put together with
        sports as a technique for mind control.<br /> The focal topic is the equivalent all through: isolate and
        prevail. <br /> The
        systems are very straightforward: impede common propensity of individuals to participate for their endurance,
        and train them to frame groups bowed on control and winning.<br /> Sports has consistently had a job as a key
        diversion that corrals innate propensities into a non-significant occasion, which in present day America has
        arrived at silly extents where challenges will break out over a game VIP leaving their city, yet basic human
        issues, for example, freedom are chuckled away as immaterial.<br />
        Food, Water, and Air – Additives, poisons, and other nourishment harms actually modify mind science to make
        mildness and indifference.<br /> Fluoride in drinking water has been demonstrated to bring down IQ; Aspartame
        and MSG
        are excitotoxins which energize synapses until they kick the bucket; and simple access to the inexpensive food
        that contains these toxins by and large has made a populace that needs center and inspiration for a functioning
        way of life.<br /> The vast majority of the cutting edge world is flawlessly prepped for uninvolved
        responsiveness —
        and acknowledgment — of the authoritarian tip top.<br />
        Medications — we can equate this to any addictive substance, however the mission of mind controllers is to be
        certain you are dependent on something.<br /> One noteworthy arm of the cutting edge mind control motivation is
        psychiatry, which expects to characterize all individuals by their issue, instead of their human potential.
        <br /> This
        was foreshadowed in books, for example, Brave New World.<br /> Today, it has been taken to considerably assist
        limits
        as a medicinal oppression has grabbed hold where about everybody has a type of confusion — especially the
        individuals who question authority. <br /> The utilization of nerve tranquilizes in the military has prompted
        record
        quantities of suicides. <br /> To top it all off, the cutting edge medication state currently has over 25% of
        U.S.
        youngsters on mind-desensitizing drugs.<br />
        Military testing — There is a long history associated to the military as the proving ground for mind
        control.<br />
        The military personality is maybe the most pliable, as the individuals who seek after life in the military by
        and large resound to the structures of progression, control, and the requirement for unchallenged submission to
        a mission.<br /> For the expanding number of military individual scrutinizing their influence, an ongoing story
        featured DARPA's arrangements for trans cranial mind control head protectors that will keep them centered.<br />
        Electromagnetic range — An electromagnetic soup encompasses all of us, charged by present day gadgets of comfort
        which have been appeared to directly affect mind work.<br /> In an implicit affirmation of what is conceivable,
        one
        scientist has been working with a 'divine being head protector' to instigate dreams by adjusting the
        electromagnetic field of the mind.<br /> Our advanced soup has us latently washed by conceivably mind-changing
        waves,
        while a wide scope of potential outcomes, for example, phone towers is currently accessible to the eventual
        personality controller for more straightforward mediation.<br />

        Chapter 9: Manipulation and Persuasion<br />
        What is Manipulation?<br />

        For many people, manipulation is a faraway phenomenon that happens to other people, and not to themselves.<br />
        It is
        unlikely that you will be going about your day thinking about manipulation or worrying that others are
        manipulating you.<br /> Yet the truth of the matter is, manipulation is everywhere around us.<br /> It is in
        sales adverts
        that try to entice you to buy something that you do not need by convincing you that you do need it. <br />It is
        in the
        puppy eyes of a lover or child trying to get something out of you.<br /> Manipulation is also at play when a
        passenger
        is trying to charm a flight attendant into getting a first-class upgrade.<br /> In short, manipulation is
        everywhere
        in your daily life. <br />The only reason it goes unnoticed is because high chances are that you are not looking
        out
        for it. <br />In many cases, it is often so subtle that even if you were looking for it, you would not notice
        it.<br />

        First things first, what is the textbook definition of manipulation? Merriam-Webster dictionary has various
        definitions for manipulation, among them: to manage or utilize skillfully; to control by unfair means in order
        to gain advantage and ; to change by unfair means in order to serve one’s purpose.<br />

        Three psychological conditions that are associated with manipulation are narcissism, psychosis, and
        sociopathy.<br />
        Before talking about how the different ways manipulators might attempt to influence others, we’ll give some
        background on these underlying psychological conditions.<br />

        A narcissist suffers from narcissistic personality disorder, or NPD. <br />As is true of many psychological
        measures,
        NPD can be seen as existing on a spectrum; people might have it to differing degrees.<br />

        The overarching characteristics of NPD include the following:

        • A grandiose self-image that might exaggerate the sufferer’s importance, talent, or achievements.<br />

        • A lack of empathy for other people.<br />

        • A strong need for admiration from others.<br />

        • Unrealistic fantasies of power, achievement, success, or idealized love.<br />

        • A belief in a unique or special status that can only be understood by an elite few.<br />

        • An expectation of special or deferential treatment.<br />

        • A general attitude of arrogance.<br />

        • An envy of others or delusional belief that he or she is subject to the envy of others.<br />

        • A willingness to exploit or manipulate others.<br />

        Obviously, this last characteristic is the most relevant to our purposes, but most of the others point towards
        the basic psychology of narcissism that so enables manipulation. <br />The strong egocentric framing, the
        delusions of
        grandeur and the lack of empathy lead to a personality perfectly willing to pursue self-interested behavior at
        the expense of others.<br />

        Within the broader category of narcissists there is a spectrum of subtypes that ranges from exhibitionist
        narcissists to closeted ones. <br />There are some who are unapologetically abusive and vindictive and others
        that are
        thoughtful and capable of remorse.<br /> The more fully a narcissist conforms to the above list of
        characteristics,
        the more likely they are to be considered a malignant narcissist; one capable of inflicting harm.<br />

        Antisocial Personality Disorder, or APD, is the clinical diagnosis for sociopathy. <br />Like narcissism,
        sociopathy
        tends to be a long-lived condition, often permanent, and has extensive effects. <br />To meet the clinical
        definition,
        an APD sufferer must demonstrate a conduct disorder by the age of fifteen which includes at least four of the
        following characteristics.<br />

        • Inability to maintain consistency in work or schoolwork.<br />

        • Ignored social norms. May engage in illegal behavior.<br />

        • A casual disregard for safety concerns, either concerning the self or others.<br />

        • Irresponsibility, as seen on the job or in a failure to honor obligations of a financial nature.<br />

        • Difficulty in maintaining monogamous relationships for over a year.<br />

        • Impulsive and lacking in ambition or planning, tending to proceed without clear goals.<br />

        • Easily irritated and aggressive or violent.<br />

        • A lack of concern with honesty. <br />This might be demonstrated by continuous lying, conning people, reneging
        on
        debts, or using aliases.<br />

        These first two categories are similar in both their positive and negative characteristics. <br />Either can be
        intelligent, charismatic or successful.<br /> At the same time, narcissists and sociopaths can both be
        controlling,
        irresponsible, and proceed with an exaggerated sense of entitlement. <br />Both can be abusive and both tend to
        refuse
        to take responsibility for this behavior. <br />They tend to produce justifications for their worst
        behaviors.<br /> On a
        core level, both tend to lack empathy, although they may be able to fake empathetic reactions when it benefits
        them.<br />

        Although they do have similarities, there are important distinctions between the two categories.<br /> In the
        Venn
        diagram of disorders, all sociopaths are narcissists, but not all narcissists qualify as sociopaths. <br />They
        differ
        in motivations.<br /> Sociopaths tend to be more cunningly manipulative, because everything isn’t personal for
        them.<br />
        Narcissists are ego-driven, but for sociopaths, the ego isn’t a factor. <br />They can, in fact, be viewed as
        lacking
        a real personality. <br />They can inhabit any persona that is convenient to a given situation. <br />This makes
        sociopaths
        harder to identify.<br /> Their tactics shift relative to a situation. <br />They may try to win the approval of
        others, but
        only if it acts in service of their goals.<br /> They can perform humility, seeming to show remorse, but again,
        this
        is strategic and based on an agenda.<br /> Sociopaths act with a higher level of planning and calculation.<br />
        Even
        aggression might be premeditated.<br />

        Narcissists are more reactive. <br />They may employ lies and attempt to intimidate, but are more likely to do
        it
        without a game plan, simply reacting to a situation driven by their overactive egos. <br />A narcissist will
        work
        towards their own success or goal of achieving some measure of perfection. <br />They are perfectly willing to
        exploit
        others as they pursue these goals, but the manipulation is secondary and directed towards personal interests and
        a self-centered worldview.<br />


        A third category of manipulative personality type worth discussing includes psychopaths. <br />Psychosis is
        distinguished by a difficulty in distinguishing fantasy and reality.<br /> Sufferers may be delusional or
        hallucinatory. <br />The following list contains common traits of psychopaths. <br />While many of these are
        shared in our
        previous two categories, remember the important distinguishing factors defining psychosis.<br />

        • Exaggerated sense of self worth<br />

        • Fleeting or shallow emotions<br />

        • A lack of empathy<br />

        • Unwillingness to accept responsibility for actions<br />

        • Inability to form realistic long-term goals<br />

        • Impulsive behavior<br />

        • A lack of responsibility<br />

        • Inability to control behavior<br />

        • Superficially charming and glib<br />

        • Being conning and manipulative<br />

        Psychopaths tend to mislead and manipulate others through dishonestly and a superficial charm that can come off
        as glib. <br /> Psychopaths may mislead in order to gain advantage or they might be motivated to deceive and
        abuse
        merely for their own amusement.<br /> Some simply cannot resist these negative impulses. <br />Typically,
        psychopaths have
        developed these characteristics over the course of their entire lives. <br />They have incorporated them into an
        often
        basically functional routine. <br />Sometimes the traits are even externally reinforced to an extent.<br /> As a
        result,
        they don’t see these characteristics as problematic. <br />In fact, people with high levels of psychopathy often
        are
        largely unconcerned with how they are perceived, exhibiting a willingness to demonstrate their fearlessness even
        if it means they will be overtly perceived as dominating. <br />They also tend not to worry about the
        consequences of
        their actions on others. <br />As they tend to have very little empathy, impacts such as these seem
        irrelevant.<br /> They
        do, in fact, feel that their motivations are of innately greater concerns than those of others. <br />This
        contributes
        to a delusional regard of their own motives and actions, as if they served some higher purpose. <br />The
        delusional
        nature of psychosis also contributes to the fact that psychotics often believe their own lies. <br />Lying is
        natural
        to highly psychotic people, but that does not mean they are always conscious that they are lying. <br />Their
        detachment from reality can lead them to feel and believe what they are saying even when it is motivated by
        conscious deception. <br /> All of these characteristics naturally contribute to a high correlation of
        manipulative
        behavior and diagnoses of psychosis. <br />

        People with other psychological conditions or those who are in perfect mental health are perfectly capable of
        engaging in manipulative behavior under the right circumstances. <br />
        When it comes to manipulation, there is a slight difference from persuasion.<br /> The difference is that at
        some
        points, it is, in fact, the right thing to ask them to change their behavior directly. <br />Now, you don't want
        to
        pull this out as your first move.<br /> This is something you build up to after a long conversation — after you
        accomplish steps zero and one, just as you do for persuasion. <br />But the big difference between changing
        someone's
        ideas and changing their behaviors is here in step two: more often than not, you should directly tell them what
        you think they should do differently.<br />

        When NLP newcomers learn this at first, they are totally taken aback.<br /> They think, how could I possibly be
        told
        to tell them directly to change their behavior? But if you think through it a little longer, it makes
        sense.<br />
        What is the difference between belief and behavior? Persuasion changes belief by getting close to someone's mind
        and changing what is in there, and manipulation is getting closer to their mind and changing what is in there,
        too.<br />

        But with manipulation, there is the added hurdle of getting them to follow up on the change in thought.<br />
        While it
        is absolutely true that all of our behavior ultimately comes from our mind, our brains are still not simple
        masters of our actions.<br /> Rather, our actions are determined by multiple factors other than simply what our
        brain
        tells us to do.<br /> The reason you eventually have to ask your subject to change their actions directly is
        that for
        new behaviors, a change in thought is just not enough.<br />

        Your subject needs voices other than the one in their head, telling them what to do. <br />They have the thought
        you
        got into their head through NLP; you are telling them directly, too.<br /> But there is still more you have to
        do.<br />

        Social bonds are incredibly important to human beings.<br /> If you want to manipulate someone's behavior,
        unlike when
        you persuade them into having new thoughts, these thoughts alone are not enough. <br />You telling them what to
        do is
        not enough, even once they have recognized you as like them.<br /> If you want to change their behavior, next,
        you
        have to change the social environment of the person with the undesired behavior. <br />


        This is not a catch-all for manipulation, because nothing is. <br />After all, not in every situation will you
        be able
        to change the social environment of your subject. <br />If they are not friends or family, but rather a
        co-worker,
        this could prove much more challenging. <br />It is only fitting since manipulation is a more difficult and
        complicated task than persuasion.<br />

        But if this is a person whose social environment you have some control over, you have to determine what social
        factors are leading to undesired behaviors.<br /> Is there another family member enabling their drinking or drug
        use?
        This is the most prominent example, but all of it is emblematic of the NLP manipulation framework in
        general.<br />

        All of this is to say that when you are not in control of a person's social environment, directly telling them
        what action they should take is a necessary and challenging part of the process.<br /> It is so challenging
        because
        there is no way around it, and it is also very easy to do the wrong way.<br />

        You have to work hard not to work too hard for them.<br /> If they can see how badly you want them to change
        their
        behavior, they will want to continue acting the way they do out of spite.<br /> Don't give them this
        opportunity.<br />

        Recall how with persuasion, we said never to address objections to your frame. <br />In fact, if at all
        possible, you
        don't want to address the frame itself. <br />That's because if you address the frame itself, you are
        acknowledging
        the fact that it is not the naturally-occurring reality that you want your subject to see it as.<br /> However,
        with
        manipulation, the situation is different than it is for persuasion.<br />

        With manipulation, you have to respond to objections directly, because you have to tug harder than you do with
        persuasion. <br />You see, persuasion is a subtler, quieter art than manipulation. <br />This is a direct way of
        saying that
        manipulation is loud and aggressive, because it is not.<br />

        But you can't be quite as gentle with manipulation. <br />You want them to change their habits, so in order to
        get
        your subject to understand the gravity of the situation enough to trigger the behavior change, it is necessary
        that you are slightly pushier than you are with persuasion. <br />Again: don't be pushy, but you can't be as
        subtle as
        you are with persuasion.<br />

        Even when you deal with their objections, you are better off preparing for them before they come up.<br /> When
        you
        are ready for any question or complaint your subject can haul at you, it is a signal to them that you are like
        them, you see things from their side, and perhaps, you know better.<br /> This is Step One yet again.<br /> If
        you
        demonstrate that you are like them and can reason things out better, they will listen.<br /> You are almost
        ready to
        get into the techniques of manipulation, but before then, you need to get into the personality of the NLP
        manipulator.<br />

        You might think that you are born with a certain personality, and you can't do anything to change it, but this
        couldn't be further from the truth. <br />In fact, the kind of personality you should adopt to get people to do
        what
        you want is one that anyone can learn.<br />

        Why is learning this personality so important? Well, it's important because you need to seem like you are
        positive about what you are saying.<br /> If you seem even a teensy bit unsure in any of your speech or your
        body
        language, nobody is going to buy what you are selling. <br />That's why in your body language, dress, facial
        expression, tone of voice, and words, you need to pull off the personality of someone who knows what they are
        talking about.<br />

        They have the answer to your question; they know what's what. <br />If you can pull off that personality, you
        basically don't have to do anything else. <br />Personality is everything — don't forget that.<br />

        Personality is so important because no matter how unlikely something seems on the surface, if it comes out of
        the mouth of the right personality, people will believe in it.<br /> You have to believe in what you are saying
        to
        some extent if you expect to pull this off, so don't think you can playact your way through the whole thing —
        after all, you are not doing the personality right if you are unsure about the merits of what you are
        saying.<br />
        But more important than anything you say is the personality you are displaying while you say it.<br />

        Not everyone has this naturally, but it is not nearly as hard to learn as you might think.<br /> The right place
        to
        start is always your breathing and your posture. <br /> You already know what the right posture to take is —
        stand up
        straight and without shaking.<br /> Now, take deep breaths like for your state control exercises. <br />Just
        like before,
        don't breathe loudly. <br />Breathe deeply but not in a way that anyone can tell is unusual.<br />

        The third and final thing you have to do is enter the headspace of this unshakeable personality. <br />Everyone
        has
        experienced a moment where everything was going right for them, and that is exactly the place you need to
        go.<br />
        Revisit that memory as though you were there again right now, and come back as the person you were in that
        memory.<br />

        The world is at your fingertips just like it was back then, especially if you carry this person inside of
        you.<br />
        That person is necessary to succeed in manipulating people's behavior in the techniques coming up, so be sure
        you have your personality ready before reading.<br /> You won't be able to pull these off otherwise.<br />

        Chapter 10: Characteristics of Manipulators.<br />
        Use of Language.<br />

        We have shown how powerful language can be, as a prime tool of persuasion.<br /> There is more to the
        manipulative
        controller though than mere words. <br />They will use tactics that mislead and unbalance their target’s inner
        thoughts. <br />We now understand that through language, they will:<br />

        • Use mistruths to mislead and confuse their target's normal thinking pattern.<br />

        • Force their target to make a decision at speed, so they don’t have time to analyze and think.<br />

        • Talk to their target in an overwhelming manner, making them feel small.<br />

        • Criticize their target's judgment so they begin to lose their own self-esteem.<br />

        • Raise the tone of their voice and not be afraid to use aggressive body language.<br />

        • Ignore their target's needs, they are only interested in getting what they want and at any cost.<br />

        Invasion of Personal Space<br />

        Most of us set boundaries around ourselves without realizing we are doing so.<br /> It is a kind of unspoken
        rule to
        protect our own private space, such as not sitting so close that you are touching another person, especially a
        stranger. <br />A manipulative character cares nothing about overstepping such boundaries.<br /> Whether this is
        because
        they do not understand, or they do not care is unclear. <br />Initially, they are unlikely to invade their
        target's
        personal space. <br />They will seek to build up a good rapport first.<br /> This shows that they do understand
        boundaries
        because once they gain the confidence of their target, they will then ignore them.<br />

        Fodder for Thought<br />

        Manipulators tend to be very ego-centric, with limited social skills.<br /> Their only concern is for
        themselves.<br />
        Everything they do in life will be in relation to how it affects them, not how their actions affect
        others.<br /> Does
        this mean that they have a psychopathic disorder?<br />

        Take empathy for instance. <br />Controlling manipulators are unlikely to ever show empathy. <br />Empathy is a
        natural
        human emotion that aids in our survival techniques. A study by Meffert et al. indicates that those with a
        psychopathic disorder are able to control empathetic emotions (4c). They lack sympathy of any kind because
        another weakness is simply another tool for them. When they detect any weakness in their target's resolve or
        personality, they will exploit it. The consequences to their victim are of little importance. The targets
        weakness's feed the manipulator's strength, making them bolder and often crueler in their actions.

        Creating Rivalry

        Another tactic of the controlling manipulator is backstabbing. They may tell you how great a person you are to
        your face, making themselves look good. Behind your back, they are busy spreading malicious gossip and untruths
        about you. This is a classic trait of a controlling manipulator as it creates a rivalry between people. Then,
        they can pick sides that will make them look favorable, particularly to their target. It can act as the first
        stage to getting close to their target. Once bonded, they can start to build up trust, making it easier to
        manipulate the target in the future. If you recognize a backstabber, keep them at a distance. Their agenda is
        selfish so it is better not let them into your personal life. There is no point treating them as they treat you,
        in revenge. It will turn out to be exhausting playing them at their own game. If they know that you are on to
        them, they may attempt to lure you back with praise, remember that it is false.



        Domineering Personality

        It is unlikely that a manipulative person will outwardly show any form of weakness. An important part of their
        facade is to show conviction about their views. They seek to impress, believing they are right about everything.
        Almost to the point that if they realize they are wrong, they will still argue that they are right. On a
        one-to-one level, that invariably means that your position is always wrong. As they will chip away at your
        beliefs, they seek to undermine your sense of self-esteem. Once they have achieved this, then there is no
        holding them back. They seek to domineer others, often speaking with a condescending tone to belittle their
        victims. Using ridicule is yet another tool against their target, merely because it will make themselves look
        better. If you ridicule them back, they will seek to turn the tables, accusing you of being oversensitive to
        their “joke.” The type of joke that the teller is the only one seeing the funny side.

        Passive Aggressive Behavior

        A common trait of many hard-core manipulators is passive aggressive behavior. Because they prefer to be popular,
        they do not wish to be seen as doing anything wrong. Not that a manipulator would ever admit to doing anything
        wrong. They are experts with facial expressions that are meant to dominate and intimidate. This may include;
        knitting eyebrows, grinding teeth and rolling eyes. It may also include noises such as tutting and grunting
        sounds. It is a very common behavior for such a character, as there is little anyone else has to say that they
        will agree upon. For most manipulators, it is their life’s ambition to show people up by proving them wrong.
        This can range from the confrontational look, where they seek to stare their target down. Or, it could be in
        response to their disagreement on something their target said. They may smirk and shake their head, turn their
        back, anything to show their strong disapproval. It is all a ploy to make themselves look superior and put
        others down.



        Moody Blues

        What of emotional stability of the manipulator? Is it that which makes them behave the way they do? Do they even
        know what happiness is? The answer to that is a most definite yes, at least to the latter.

        Happiness is a tool used initially to help them manipulate, a happy target is more likely to comply. This, in
        itself, makes the manipulator happy, or at least in a sense of what they consider happiness. But their
        joyfulness is a perverted model of what most others consider happiness to be. Their happiness is often built on
        the foundations of another’s misery. A misery that they have caused with their cruel manipulations. Equally
        though, a manipulator is prone to mood swings. Most likely to happen when things are not going to plan. One
        minute they are euphoric at their latest conquest. Then next they could be completely deflated at their failure
        to succeed. One thing is certain for those who live with or become a target of this type of domineering
        character, they will be unhappy all the time.

        Intimidation

        One aspect of manipulation, often used as a last resort, is intimidation and bullying. When everything else has
        failed, they begin to use threats to get their own way. Some though may use intimidation from the onset. It may
        in a source of authority. For example, let's take the role of a manipulative boss. You have requested a day off.
        They don't want to allow you your request but have no choice, it is your right. This type of person would want
        their pound of flesh first. They will set goals for you to reach so it will delay or cancel your request, such
        as moving project deadlines forward. This way they have their little victory over you.

        Alternatively, such a manipulator may use the tactic of the silent treatment. Ignoring someone to the point that
        it becomes obvious you have displeased them. They seek to make you feel the guilty party.

        Other more direct intimidating actions may include stance. Using their height or build to tower over you, or
        standing uncomfortably close. Be careful as they will seek revenge for wrongdoings they perceive done to them.
        Nothing will go unnoticed under their watchful eye. Everyone is a potential target. But, the weak are more
        likely to walk into their traps, because they are the ones who are easier to dominate. The vulnerable will have
        little resistance and are easier to bully and coerce. Many of these traits seem more fitting to men, but women
        can be cruelly manipulative too.

        This is a person who will never back down in an argument. Never admit they are wrong. Never apologize for
        anything. A manipulator will never show respect but will expect everyone else to show them respect. They love
        nothing more than to embarrass others. Playing the dumb one is common practice, just to force another person to
        explain themselves further. At every opportunity, the manipulator will jump in with some sarcastic remark,
        “hurry up, we’re all waiting for your intellectual explanation,” or “why has no one else ever heard of this?”
        Their sole aim is to make the other person look a fool, but without seeming to be the one who made it happen. Oh
        no, the victim did that to themselves because they are stupid.

        Techniques of Manipulation
        The approaches we can use to manipulate someone’s behaviors are so numerous that they themselves could fill an
        entire book. Thankfully, this chapter explains the most valuable approaches with more than enough detail for you
        to start employing them yourself.

        Take note of how each method depends on your knowledge of dark psychology and NLP — without them, you can’t
        begin to use them reliably, and that’s why this is just one part of manipulation and persuasion. Our first
        method has been coined as “fear and relief” — in this method, you evoke someone else’s fear, and then relieve
        them by telling them there is still something they can do.

        As usual, we want to remind you of the importance of considering ethics with manipulation. If you aren't
        comfortable doing it, you should consider whether you should be doing it in the first place. Just because
        something is going to benefit you, doesn't mean it's something you should do.

        That said, using fear and relief is not an unethical thing to do in every situation, even though it is not
        everyone's cup of tea.

        The technique of manipulation works just as you think it would — first, you talk with your subject like you
        always would. You start out with your state control; that way, you are ready for whatever reaction they give to
        this tactic. Next, you get closer to them. Despite the name, as you can see, fear is not the very first thing
        you start with. If you literally started with fear, they wouldn't trust you in the first place, and the relief
        would mean nothing to them. Perhaps the better name for this method would be the peace, fear, and relief method.

        Peace is where Step 1 takes place. Match up with their unconscious brain language just like you always do for
        NLP. After that, you bring in the step of fear. You don't jump scare them, but rather you give them the
        impression that something bad is going to happen. What you say for this depends on what you are trying to get
        them to do. Whatever it is, it has to be bad enough that they will be convinced to change what they were already
        going to do. The key is they have to think it is important enough for them to change their actions.

        There is another key part of it too, however. Your subject needs to be relieved very soon after they were made
        to be scared, because otherwise, they will just associate the fear with you. Your subject associating you with
        fear will make Step 1 much harder in the future, so it's very important that you don't let this happen. Relieve
        them as soon as you can, and don't let them think you scared them on purpose. This will preserve their
        positively-valenced idea of you, but still, put that fear into their head to get them to change their behavior.

        You cannot neglect the thinking side of manipulation. It is still very much necessary, because without it you
        wouldn't be changing their minds in the first place. To begin with, we have to go back to frames and their
        structures.

        We already talked about the importance of adaptability with frames with persuasion. That is still completely
        true with manipulation, so keep that in mind. We just don't want to repeat all of it when you just read it, so
        go back over it again if you need to. But with manipulation, you need to take the structure of framing into
        greater consideration than you did before.

        That's because if you want someone to change their action, rather than thought, it takes much more drastic
        measures. You need to directly ask them to change their behavior, but you also need to more directly get them to
        confront their ideas.

        What is the structure of a frame? On a basic level, the structure is that of cause and effect. The cause is what
        is happening in the outside world, and the effect is how it affects the subject. Before you get your subject to
        change their behavior, they have a certain idea about how their actions affect them and other people.

        Your job as an NLP manipulator is to show them how their current framing of cause of effect is wrong. When you
        change someone's framing, this is called Deframing. Deframing is a crucial part of manipulation, because
        remember, you need to take drastic measures by getting someone to change their behaviors.

        If they are thinking the same way they were before when you are done with them, they aren't going to change
        their behavior — just like there is no chance they are changing their behavior unless someone tells them they
        should directly. If no one does, they will never even stop to consider the idea that this is something they
        should do.

        Don't forget that manipulation is a matter of both thought and action. While persuasion was all about getting
        into someone's mind, manipulation is still about that, but it now has an added element of action. And if you
        want to get someone to change their action, there is a new idea you will have to learn. It is called behavioral
        tone.

        Behavioral tone is a lot like one's emotional intensity, but it is the intensity of one's actions. Don't get the
        wrong idea, here, because you don't want to scare anyone. But you don't have to scare anyone to come off as a
        strong person.

        Being a strong person is what becoming a confident personality was all about. If you have this kind of
        personality, everyone will listen to you. But more importantly, for the matter of manipulation, people will do
        what you say, as well.

        If you want people to do what you tell them to do, as the saying goes, actions speak louder than words. People
        don't think logically in the way that everyone acts as they do. Instead, they are driven by a number of factors.
        And one thing that will get them to change their ways every time is a strong personality shaking things up in
        their life.

        These chapters are rife with information, and it can probably be overwhelming if you consume them all at once.
        For this reason, we absolutely recommend coming back to them. But even though it wouldn't cover everything we
        have been through, we will summarize the basics of manipulation before we move on to mind reading.

        Manipulation requires more overt means than persuasion because getting someone to change their behavior is no
        subtle matter. People's minds are easy to change without their ever knowing, but changing their actions requires
        changes on multiple fronts, and the mind is only one.

        If people, you should try to change their social environment to stop their undesirable behavior. But if that is
        not possible, you need to emphasize how it is all on them to change their behavior; you need to tell them
        directly what you think they need to change; finally, you need to use the fear and relief method to make them
        see what bad things could happen if they do not change.

        Now that you are clear on the landscapes and techniques of persuasion and manipulation, it is time to dive into
        the world of mind reading, psychic resistance, and more.



        1. Lack of open and honest conversations

        In some churches, you are not allowed to ask questions. If you find yourself in such a situation, you are met
        with excuses or dismissal on not getting the information. It is okay when there are concerns not to divulge
        information that will interfere with the privacy of other members. The leaders should take responsibility for
        their actions and always be ready to explain to the members why there are certain rules. Church information
        should be open to its members, and there should be transparency.

        2. Leaders never admit their mistakes

        We can forgive our pastors for making mistakes. After all, they are human beings, but it is difficult to forgive
        them when they fail to communicate. Yes, I know what the Bible says about forgiveness, but remember, I am a
        human being too. When leaders refuse to admit to their mistakes and are always spinning their actions to fit
        those of a perfect Lamb of God, they create a difficult situation. You should watch out for some recurring
        defensiveness in your church's leadership. You should also watch out if the church is masking some of its
        mistakes.

        3. They use shame as an influence mechanism

        Some churches in our community use shame to influence their members. They will shame their members for giving
        little money, shame them for missing the service and shame them for their actions. Even with no knowledge of the
        world, the Bible is clear that to those who belong to Christ, there is no condemnation. Remember, none of those
        in the church leadership will sit on the judgment seat at the end of the world. Some act as if they have the
        final say on who will enter the gates of heaven. They will use the carrot and stick theory to manipulate you.

        4. They are selective

        First of all, you should understand that God created us all equally, and He accepts us the way we are. In some
        churches, they will restrict you to dress in a certain manner, they will choose people of a certain color, and
        they will force their members to follow some stipulated rules for them to fellowship in that church. The church
        should not have superficial lines but should be an all-inclusive place. The church should emulate Christ, who
        embraced all the rich such as Lazarus and the prostitutes, such as Mary Magdalene. Do not get me wrong; rules
        and regulations are important to run any organization but rules created to exclude a certain group of people in
        the wrong. Church leaders should know that they are servants.

        Now I do not want you to think that pastors are evil for such actions above. You might find that some are not
        even aware of these manipulative actions, but others do it intentionally. Flipping the coin, pastors are also
        prone to manipulation. The church members can do it without the pastors realizing it. All the same, neither of
        the manipulations is acceptable. Let us look at the other side of the coin and find out how the church members
        can manipulate their pastors.

        Compliments

        Compliments are good as they encourage us and make us feel good. Now some members may use compliments to
        manipulate you. They will seek to influence your decisions in the church’s agenda through flattery. You should
        watch out for such signs, as they are as bad as using criticism to bully another.

        Criticisms

        Well, you can never avoid criticism, especially if you have a leadership role. During conversations, some
        members will criticize your actions using their tone and sometimes body language. Always follow the church’s
        rules and regulations and the teachings of the Bible. Be gentle when responding to such scenarios, and you will
        settle the manner amicably.

        Silence

        They tell us that silence is the best tool to silence manipulation, but it can also be a sign of manipulation.
        You find members giving you the silent treatment to control you. The pastor should be aware of this and should
        not carry the burden but instead should pray for the members.

        Prayers

        Pastors should take caution with the people they share with their burdens. They should protect themselves and
        their families from over-exposure. They should find trusted friends to share with their challenges, and even
        then, they should choose what is important to share and what is not.

        Families

        Manipulation happens in all kinds of relationships. It can be intentionally used or unintentionally, but in the
        end, the other party ends up doing something they did not want to do in the first place. In our homes, parents
        can manipulate their children, and the children can manipulate their parents as well. Children have an early
        exposure at an early age that they can get what they want through tantrums and when you give in, they get
        control. Away from the children. Now, what are the signs that teens are manipulating their caregivers?


        1. Steamrolling

        Teenagers make endless and repetitive requests that are meant to wear out the caregivers to get their way. They
        will use the ‘can I’ ‘how about now’ language all the time. The act like a broken record that keeps playing the
        same song repeatedly.

        2. Lying

        Teenagers love to tell little white lies or omitting some parts of the truth to get what they want. They leave
        out some details if given, would change your affirmation to their request. Most of them also collaborate on the
        small lies in case the parents communicate; they will have the same information and allow them their request.

        3. Retaliation

        Most teenagers do some hurtful things to retaliate for not getting their way. They will not clean their room;
        they will dress inappropriately, they will put on loud music; all these as an attempt to get even with you. It
        is difficult because you cannot yell at them to stop since they are no longer children, and most caregivers end
        up giving in to their demands to avoid these hurtful actions.

        Caregivers can as well manipulate their children, and it is bad since the children are in their developing age,
        and it makes their life difficult. Briefly, let us look at the signs that a caregiver is manipulating the child.

        They do not give the child security and affirmation
        They are always critical.
        The caregiver always demands the attention of the child.
        The caregiver makes toxic jokes about the child.
        The caregiver does not allow the child to express their negative emotions
        The caregiver scares the child.




        Politics

        Politicians engage the emotional system of your brains to get political mileage. They use fear, disgust, and
        anger and never compassion or hope. Politicians never inspire us to work together for the common good of us all.
        They use anger, fear, and disgust to manipulate how we vote. They influence how we feel about other candidates
        and their policies. Most of us are never aware that we are being manipulated.

        Informing you that the turn-out will be high
        Politicians will tell you that they turn out will be high to motivate you to go to the polls. If they told you
        that the turnout would be low, most would not turn out since it depresses the efforts to go out and vote.

        Public shaming
        The politicians will never shame you publicly to safeguard their reputation and their votes, but they can use
        other means to make you feel bad for not voting. You would get ads and letters asking you what your relatives
        and friends would think of you if you did not vote. It will push you to vote.

        Making promises or threats to follow up with you
        It is natural for human beings to do things in the right way when their actions are under observation. In the
        2010 US election, some people received a letter to encourage them to vote. Others received the same letter, but
        with an addition that they will be called to share their voting experience. It brought more voter turnout than
        the previous general election.



        Chapter 12: Brain washing
        Now that we know where brainwashing started, let’s look at the definition of the term. Brainwashing can simply
        be defined as a process where a person or a group of people make use of some underhand methods to talk someone
        into changing their will to that of the manipulator. When discussing this topic, it is important to delineate
        between honest persuasion and brainwashing, as there are several ways that people persuade one another these
        days, especially in the field of politics.

        A very easy way that people persuade others to conform to their will is by stating a few things that could
        typically induce a yes response from the target. They then use some statement of facts as the icing on the cake.
        At the end, they state what it is that they want people to do. For example, consider the speech below: “Are you
        tired of paying exorbitant fares for your child's schooling? What about the rising prices of gas and power
        supply? Are you concerned about the constant riots and strikes? Well, a good point to recall that the government
        has mentioned the country is gradually drawing close to recession and that the prices of fuel will continue to
        rise as they are seeing the greatest drop in the economy since the end of the civil war. If you want the country
        to change for the better, vote democrats.' The truth is that you may not want to agree with the fact that these
        are brainwashing techniques which may come off as subtle persuasion and that they are techniques in the hands of
        manipulators.

        Some of the common manipulation techniques that you should watch out for include:

        Isolation:

        When trying to brainwash a person, one of the first things usually done is the isolation of the victim from
        their family, friends and loved ones. This is to ensure that the victim will not have any other person to talk
        to besides the manipulator. So, the victim will get all their ideas and information from the manipulator while
        avoiding any likelihood of a third party stepping in to ask what is going on.

        Attack on the victim’s self-esteem:

        Since the manipulator has successfully isolated the victim, he must look for a way to break his will and
        self-esteem. They will then use the process to begin to rebuild the victim in whatever image they wish to. The
        only way a person can be brainwashed is if the person manipulating them is superior to them. This attack on the
        person’s self-esteem would manifest in the form of intimidation, ridicule or mocking the victim.

        Mental abuse:

        The manipulator will try to brainwash their victim by putting them through a phase of mental torture. They will
        do this by telling lies to the victim and making them feel embarrassed by telling them the truth in front of
        other people. They can also bully these victims by badgering them and not leaving room for them to have any form
        of personal space.

        Physical abuse:

        Manipulators understand there are many physical techniques that can be used to brainwash the victim. These
        techniques include depriving the victim of sleep and making sure that they stay cold, hungry or causing bodily
        harm by exhibiting violent behavior towards them. The manipulator can also make use of some much more subtle
        ways like increasing the noise levels, making sure that there is a light that is always flickering on and off or
        raising or lowering the room's temperature.

        Playing repetitive music:

        According to a study, if a person plays a beat repeatedly, especially a beat that has a range of about 45 to 72
        beats each minute, it is possible to introduce an extremely hypnotic state. This is because repetition is much
        closer to the rhythm that comes from the beat of the heart of a human being. This rhythm, however, can cause an
        alteration to the consciousness of the person until they reach what is known as the Alpha state, which is where
        the person becomes 25 times more suggestible than he would ordinarily be when they are in a Beta state.

        Allowing the victim to only have contact with other brainwashed people: When the manipulator is brainwashing a
        person, they ensure that the victim does not encounter any other person/people besides those that are already
        brainwashed. This is to create room for peer pressure. The truth is that everyone desires to be liked and
        accepted. This is more prevalent when a person is a new member of a group. In such a case, the person will
        typically adhere to and promote things that the other members are saying which will secure them a space with
        their new company.

        Us vs. them:

        This also has to do with the possibility of being accepted by a group. The manipulator makes the victim feel
        like there is an “us” and a “them.” So, they are offering the victim a chance to choose the group they wish to
        belong to. This is done to gain absolute loyalty and obedience from the victim.

        Love bombing:

        This technique has to do with attracting the victim to the group through physical touch and by sharing some
        intimate thoughts with the victim. Emotional bonding is also used in this technique through a show of excessive
        affection as well as constant validation.

        All the above mentioned are a few ways to brainwash a person. Once a person is brainwashed it is usually very
        difficult to get them back to normal. They develop more rigid neural pathways than other people and this could
        be an indication of why it is always very hard for a brainwashed person to double check their situation by
        rethinking it once they have been brainwashed.


        Once you have given these characters back to your life, getting rid of them will not be easy. They will appear
        to flip flop on issues and act so slippery when you want to hold them accountable. They also tend to promise you
        help that doesn’t seem to be near.

        People can be easily manipulated when they opt to put up with behaviors that are passive-aggressive. According
        to a recent study that was published in the Journal of Social & Personal Relationships, offensive people tend to
        interfere with the general performance of an individual. The study also noted that ignoring those who are
        negative could do you more harm than good. When these people are ignored, the research states that their
        productivity and intelligence is increased. More than 100 participants were examined for this study. The
        participants were asked to ignore or talk with random people who had been earlier asked to either be offensive
        or friendly.

        The participants were not aware of the kind of people they were going to meet. After interacting for about four
        minutes, each of the participants was offered a thought exercise that needed them to have a better
        concentration. The study later noted that those who ignored the negative individuals performed way much better
        than those who engaged the negative individuals.

        The researchers then summarized that ignoring some people in a serious social interaction is one better way of
        conserving the mental resources of a person. The best strategy is to avoid those who are negative in their
        speeches and actions. But at times, that can’t be enough. A negative person can also be manipulative and sneaky
        at times. In such situations, you will be forced to apply other strategies.

        The truth is that being manipulated is not a good thing. The only possible worse thing than manipulation could
        just be admitting our dirty little secrets. Each time we realize that we have been manipulated, we not only feel
        stupid but also ashamed and weak. And all that doesn’t stop there. If we continue to fall for the tricks that
        these people lay on us, they will leave us with an awful feeling about everything around us. Instead of being
        hurt for another time, the best thing to do could just be not to trust anybody.

        Manipulation can only be successful if the target fails to recognize it or just decide to allow it. But
        regardless of all that, there exists certain things that you can do to recognize that you are under manipulative
        powers. They can also help you to prevent or stop a possible case of manipulation. Some of the ideas may not be
        desirable or possible for your situation, but that’s just fine because every situation and every person is
        totally different.

        Know all your fundamental rights

        One of the single most imperative guidelines, when you are in this similar situation, is to know all your
        fundamental rights. But that’s not all, you should also recognize when any of those rights are being violated.
        Remember that you are at liberty to stand up for yourself and make sure no single fundamental right is being
        violated. You should, however, do this carefully and make sure that you do not harm others. Again, you should
        not forget that you might forfeit these rights if you cause harm to other people. Ensure you are conversant with
        some of the basic human rights such as:

        The right to be treated with dignity and respect.
        The right to express one’s wants, opinions, and feelings.
        The right to give no as an answer and maintain that without any guilty feelings.
        The right to set up one’s own standards and priorities.
        The right to take care and safeguard yourself from being emotionally, mentally, or physically threatened.
        The mentioned basic rights show the extent to which your boundaries are supposed to reach. We are living in a
        society where people don’t represent any of these rights. The mental manipulators are particularly interested in
        depriving you of your rights so that they can fully control you and take advantage of you. However, you still
        have the moral authority and power to state that you are fully in charge of your life and not the manipulator.


        Stop Self-Blaming & Personalization

        Given that the manipulator’s agenda is to know where your weakness is and exploit it, you may even throw the
        blame game on yourself for not doing your best. In such situations, it is very imperative to reassure yourself
        that you are not part of the problem. Remember that you are just being manipulated to feel bad about your
        actions and surrender your rights and power in the end. It is vital to consider the kind of relationship you
        have with the manipulator as well. These are some of the questions that you should ask yourself:

        Am I getting a respectful treatment?
        Is this relationship 1-way or 2-way?
        Am I satisfied being in this relationship?
        The answers to these issues will offer you the most important clues about whether the problem is with the
        manipulator or with you.

        Probe the Manipulators

        Mental manipulators will always make demands or requests from you. They do this to make you go the extra mile so
        that you can meet their needs. At times, it can be very important to put the focus back on the manipulator each
        time you hear certain solicitations. Ask them some analytical questions to check if they are fully aware of
        their scheme’s inequity. Ask them if their actions appear reasonable to them or if what they want from you is
        all fair.

        When you step out to ask some of these questions, you are simply placing a mirror so the manipulator will be
        able to view the real nature of his/her ploy. If the manipulator happens to be a master of self-awareness, then
        he/she will definitely withdraw and back down. Real pathological manipulators, on the other hand, will dismiss
        the question and insist on having things done their own way. When this takes place, ensure you stand up for your
        fundamental rights and the manipulators will definitely flee.

        Say No in a Firm and Diplomatic Way

        Saying no in a firm and diplomatic way is what can be defined as real communication. When it has been
        articulated in an effective manner, it will give you an opportunity to stand your ground and maintain the best
        working relationship. It is important to remember that one of your basic human rights is to set your own
        standards and priorities. It is also within your rights to say no without feeling the guilt, as well as the
        right to pick your own healthy and happy life.

        Set the Consequences

        When a mental manipulator persists on violating the boundaries that you have made and is not hearing your “no,”
        you will be forced to deploy the consequences. The ability to be able to point out and assert the consequences
        is one of the most important skills that you can deploy to resist the efforts of a manipulative person. When
        they are articulated in an effective manner, consequences will stop the actions of the manipulative person and
        even compel them to stop the violations and respect instead.

        Confront the Bullies in a Safe Way

        One fact that is not known to many is that a mental manipulator can turn into a bully when they intimidate and
        harm others. It is important to note that bullies only prey on those they regard as the weakest, and you can
        make yourself a target when you remain compliant and passive. However, the fact is that a number of bullies are
        cowards on the inside. They will often back up when their target starts to stand up for their rights. This is a
        common practice in office and surroundings, as well as in schoolyards.

        Think about the long-term consequences of the actions you undertake

        As opposed to just doing what is easiest and fastest, do not forget about the consequences that your actions can
        have. Remember that psychological manipulators are the best when it comes to making their option the easiest,
        fastest, and also the least hurtful. They are also best at keeping the people focused on their current feelings.
        That explains why people do things they later regret. Instead of dealing with a consequence, later on, make sure
        you choose to do things that you won’t be forced to rethink.



        Conclusion
        Dark psychology is at work in the whole world. You might not like this truth, but you can’t modify it.

        I hope the knowledge you’ve gained by reading this will lead you forward, and that your journey will be peopled
        with the kind of intelligent and lively folks that will make it a thrilling tapestry of experience. Sometimes
        the destination is fun to think about, but if we miss the journey on the way there, we miss out on the best
        part. Look up from the path, see who’s walking with you and then ask yourself – what did they mean by that hand
        movement? What does that facial expression mean? How do my own mannerisms mirror theirs? You’ll figure out what
        it all means while you’re on your way. Just don’t forget to enjoy the journey. It really is the very best part.

        I wish you all the best!
