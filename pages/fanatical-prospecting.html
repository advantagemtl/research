    <h1>Fanatical Prospecting</h1>

    <p>In sales, life and business, there are only three things you can control:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your actions.</li>
        <li>Your reactions.</li>
        <li>Your Mindset.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>That’s it, nothing more, so instead of whining about the things that are out of your control, focus your energy on what you can control, your attitude, choices, emotions, goals, ambitions, dreams, desires, and discipline <strong>(choose between what you want now and what you want most)</strong>.</p>

    <p>To get what you want, you must prospect consistently.</p>
    <p>Only you can make the decision to do the hard work, pick up the phone, approach strangers, and get past your own mental hang ups. Approach strangers, and get past your own mental hang ups. The choice to act, to get past your own mental hang ups, the choice to adopt a new mindset, is yours and yours alone.</p>

    <p>Here’s the brutal truth: There is no easy button in sales, prospecting is hard, emotionally draining work. And it is the price you have to pay to earn a high income.</p>

    <p>There is always something more fun I would rather do, and although I know it will never get easier, the one thing that separates me from most other people is this: <strong>I GET OVER IT AND DO IT ANYWAY</strong></p>

    <p>There’s little need for you to reinvent the wheel, if you study what successful people do, you find patterns, when you duplicate those patterns, you’ll be able to duplicate their success.</p>

    <p>Developing and maintaining a fanatical prospecting mindset is the ultimate key to success in sales.</p>

    <h2>7 Mindsets of Fanatical Prospectors</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Optimistic and enthusiastic</strong>: Negative, bitter people with a victim mindset do not succeed in sales. Attack everyday with enthusiasm - fired up and ready to roll.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive</strong>: Fanatical prospectors view prospecting through the eyes of a fierce competitor. They are hardwired to win and will do whatever it takes to stay on top. They begin each day prepared to win.</li>
        <li><strong>Confidence</strong>: Fanatical prospectors approach prospecting with confidence, they expect to win and believe they are going to win. They have mental toughness to manage disruptive emotions of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. They leverage confidence and self-control to persuade prospects to give up time and resources to engage in sales conversations.</li>
        <li><strong>Relentless</strong>: Fanatical prospectors have a high need for achievement. They do whatever it takes to reach their goal. They never, ever give up believing that persistence always wins. They use rejection as motivational fuel to get up and keep going with a determined belief that their next “Yes” is right around the corner.</li>
        <li><strong>Thirsty for knowledge</strong>: Fanatical prospectors welcome feedback and coaching, they seek out every opportunity to learn and invest in themselves by voraciously consuming books, podcasts, audiobooks, blogposts, online training, seminars and anything else they believe will make them better. They view setbacks as opportunities to learn and grow.</li>
        <li><strong>Systematic and efficient</strong>: Fanatical Prospectors have the ability to execute with near-robotic and systematical efficiency. They are skilled at their craft, like a pro athlete, they protect the golden hours, block their time, and concentrate their power to tune out distractions and avoid disruptions - they also squeeze every moment out of the sales day.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptive and flexible</strong>: Fanatical Prospectors have situational awareness, they are flexible and are able to respond and adapt quickly to changing situations.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you want sustained success in your sales career, you have to interrupt prospects. You’ll have to pick up the phone, walk in the door, send an email, or text message, or ping a prospect on LinkedIn, in other words, you will have to interrupt someone who isn’t expecting you to contact them.</p>

    <p>What’s hard about prospecting is the willingness of the salesperson to interrupt. If you don’t interrupt relentlessly, your pipeline will be anemic.</p>

    <p>The pipeline always reveals the truth. Salespeople who gravitate to a single prospecting methodology seriously suboptimize their productivity.</p>

    <p>To close anything, you will come face to face with a cruel reality: Desperation magnifies and accelerates failure and virtually guarantees that you won’t close the deals you must have to survive.</p>

    <p>Desperation taps into the downside of the law of attraction, which states that what you focus your thoughts on, you are most likely to get, when you are desperate, you no longer focus your thoughts on what is required for success, but rather on what will happen if you don’t get what you need, thereby attracting failure.</p>

    <p>The next problem with desperate need is that other people can sense your desperation. Through your actions, tone of voice, words, and body language, you send the message that you are desperate and weak. Prospects and Customers Naturally repel salespeople who are needy, desperate, and pathetic. Instead, they gravitate toward sales professionals who exude confidence. When you reek of the foul stench of desperation, people don’t want to do business with you.</p>

    <p>Finally, when you are desperate, you become emotional and act illogically, which causes you to make poor decisions.</p>

    <p>It’s hard to find energy and motivation to start prospecting when you feel like a loser -</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>The 30 Day rule:</strong> The prospecting you do in the next 30 days will pay off for the next 90 Days.<br>
        Never put prospecting aside for another day.
    </div>

    <p>Ninety Nine percent of sales slumps can be directly linked to a failure to prospect.</p>

    <p>The anatomy of sales slumps looks something like this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>At some point you stopped prospecting (the 30 Day rule)</li>
        <li>Because you stopped prospecting your PipeLine Stalls.</li>
        <li>Because the prospects in your pipeline are dead, you stop closing deals.</li>
        <li>As you experience this failure there’s erosion to your confidence.</li>
        <li>Your crumbling confidence creates negative self-talk and that further degrades your confidence, wrecks your enthusiasm. And causes you to feel like a loser.</li>
        <li>Feeling like a loser saps your energy and motivation for prospecting activity</li>
        <li>Because you don’t feel like prospecting, you call the same old dead-end prospects over and over and get nowhere.</li>
        <li>The lack of prospecting activity makes your already stale pipe even worse</li>
        <li>You start hoping for silver bullets, but because hope is not a strategy, nothing changes.</li>
        <li>Your sales days become depressing black holes of misery</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Sooner or later, we all let down our guard and find ourselves in desperate need of a sale. The cumulative impact of our poor decisions, procrastination, fears, lack of focus, and laziness have added up and suddenly we are desperately scrambling to survive.</p>

    <p><strong>The first rule of sales slumps:</strong></p>
    <p>The first rule of holes is when you are in one you stop digging. And the first rule of sales slumps is when you are in one, you start prospecting.</p>

    <p>When you find yourself in a slump, acknowledge that your negative emotions are just making things worse. And commit yourself to daily prospecting.<br>
    Do whatever it takes to get your mind focused on prospecting and committing to daily goals.<br>
    Put all your energy, emotion and effort into actions that you control.</p>

    <p>Success in sales is a simple equation of daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual activity. In other words, you are in complete control of your future.<br>
    Even in a desperate situation, if you focus on the right activity, soon the results will come.<br>
    “The more you practice, the luckier you get.”</p>

    <p>It is far more important that you prospect consistently than that you prospect using the same techniques.<br>
    Most salespeople never get lucky because they only do the minimal amount of prospecting required to squeak by, and when they do start prospecting (usually out of desperation) they expect instant miracles. When those miracles don’t happen they gripe that prospecting doesn’t work and crawl back the WARM COMFORT OF MEDIOCRITY.</p>

    <p>So, hit the phones, knock on doors, send e-mails, and text messages, pound LinkedIn, ask for referrals, attend networking events, and talk to strangers.<br>
    Be fanatical, don’t let anyone or anything stop you.</p>
