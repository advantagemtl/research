        <h2>1. Mindset for Success as a Marketer/Entrepreneur</h2>
        <p>If you’re going to be successful as a marketer or entrepreneur, you must choose to live in the “is” world —
            not the “should be” world. People are going to spend their time and money somewhere. If they spend it with
            you, you succeed. If they spend it with someone else, you fail. The fact that people are in a state of
            partial hypnosis provides a platform where you can sell them your product or service. In this book you’ll
            learn how to harness that power.</p>
        <p class="quote">You either pull the strings from outside the Matrix, or you’re in the Matrix being entertained
            by the Matrix. You can’t do both.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. How to Protect Your Productivity & Attention</h2>
        <p>Your productivity will absolutely skyrocket after you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Delete the Facebook app from your phone</li>
            <li>Realize that the world is an incessant, never-ending conspiracy to rob you of time, attention,
                creativity, and mental space</li>
            <li>Close the Facebook tab in your browser</li>
            <li>Entirely stop using Facebook in the usual fashion during work hours</li>
            <li>Block all email notifications from Facebook and other social media</li>
            <li>Disable ALL smartphone notifications from all social media apps — no banners on the screen, no little
                red numbers on your app icons, no distractions</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Facebook's Enormous Power & Data Advantage</h2>
        <p>Facebook is your portal to influencing the world — their behavior, their opinions, their purchases, their
            relationships. You need to pull the levers without letting Facebook addiction take control of you.</p>
        <p>Facebook knows what its members look like, think, enjoy, and visit because it’s the world’s largest:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Photo and video-sharing site</li>
            <li>Thought-sharing site</li>
            <li>Liking site</li>
            <li>Linking site</li>
            <li>Demographic and psychographic gathering engine</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because Facebook was the first company to put full-screen display ads in front of mobile phone users and get
            away with it on a daily basis, they have trained their users to accept this. Facebook even has suicide
            prevention tools, and its AI may detect depression way before doctors or parents. They know the one million
            other people in the world who are most like you, like the same things you like, and buy the same things you
            buy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Facebook's Talent & Misalignment with Advertisers</h2>
        <p>The company aggressively hires fresh college graduates — the brightest college grads on the planet. These are
            the smart kids — smarter than you, smarter than us — some never had a “real” job outside Facebook. They have
            never tried to live off revenue generated by an ad; they do not feel your pain.</p>
        <p>To use Facebook’s paid advertising tools effectively, it is important to understand how much its creators and
            designers are not really trying to help you. Fortunately, they do need cash and we do need clicks, so we can
            get some great work done together. We focus on the clicks and they focus on connecting the world. Don’t
            despise making a penny, especially if you can make it reliably and repeatedly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Importance of Mastering Fundamentals</h2>
        <p>The best players that have played the game were masters of fundamentals and they worked on them constantly.
            The same goes for Facebook advertisers. If you just jump in and start running an ad without knowing the
            fundamentals (or the rules), you’re not only going to get embarrassed but you’re also going to lose a lot of
            money.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. What the Book Will Teach You First</h2>
        <p>First you'll learn about the concept of a marketing funnel and how prospects become customers, second, you’ll
            learn about five levels of awareness customers must go through in order to make a purchase. Lastly, you’ll
            discover the three pillars of advertising success that make up every successful advertising campaign.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. The Marketing Funnel Explained</h2>
        <p>When most people say funnel, they are talking about the set of steps moving someone from not knowing about
            you or your business to making a purchase — in other words, it’s a sales process. A funnel is a great visual
            because sales is a process of elimination. It’s widest at the top and can hold the most people. Then it gets
            smaller and smaller as people are disqualified till you get your eventual goal.</p>
        <p>BoFu holds your stronger conversion content. This could be webinars, pricing options, comparisons, demos, and
            live sales phone calls. People at this level are the most valuable to you. So you can spend the most ad
            budget on them per person.</p>
        <p>Testimonials and customer success stories work at all levels of the funnel.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>8. Retargeting – The 98% Principle</h2>
        <p>Tip: Retargeting is a technology that helps you keep in touch with users after they leave your website. For
            most websites only 2 percent of web traffic takes any measurable action. Retargeting helps you reach the 98
            percent of users who don’t.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>9. The Buying Process & Post-Purchase Behavior</h2>
        <p>Think about it. What was the last significant purchase you made? If you’re like most people, when you think
            back, it probably started with a problem you wanted solved. When a solution feels right, all that’s left is
            finding a great logical reason to go ahead and buy, but remember: “The mind will justify what the heart has
            already decided.”</p>
        <p>After you’ve purchased your product or service, if you truly love it, you might become a raving fan and start
            telling other people about it. People do this for two main reasons:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To help others</li>
            <li>To further justify their buying decision. If their friends buy the same solution and love it, they’ll
                feel better about their purchasing decision.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>10. Five Levels of Customer Awareness (Detailed)</h2>
        <p>Customer Awareness Timeline: Unaware → Problem Aware → Solution Aware → Your Solution Aware → Most Aware.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Most Aware</strong>: The prospects who are most aware know the benefits of your specific product
                or service, they could have already purchased it in the past. This is the easiest sale. Usually you can
                just put a discount or other offer out and people will purchase.</li>
            <li><strong>Your Solution Aware</strong>: A prospect is your solution aware when they know what you sell,
                but don’t know everything it does. They might not be convinced how well your product or service works or
                might not know of its most recent improvements.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution Aware</strong>: A prospect is solution aware when they don’t know you exist but they
                know solutions exist. In this stage, you can name the desire or solution in your ad, but you don’t want
                to have much about your company since it’s unfamiliar to the prospect. You have to give proof to
                logically lead people to considering your brand vs your competitors.</li>
            <li><strong>Problem Aware</strong>: A prospect is problem aware when they have a need, but don’t recognize
                it as a problem. You’ll need to name the problem and let prospects know there is a solution.</li>
            <li><strong>Unaware</strong>: A prospect is Unaware when they don’t know they have a need or problem (or
                they just won’t admit it to themselves). Your ad has to make people aware of the problem.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these stages holds very different prospects. Each level of awareness has different needs and they
            need to be addressed differently. If you sell anything more complicated than an impulse buy (like a kitchen
            gadget or toy), it’s very rare that you can do all of this with a single ad.</p>
    </div>

        <h2>11. The Three Pillars of Advertising Success</h2>
        <p>The three pillars of advertising success:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The right audience</li>
            <li>The right Creative</li>
            <li>The right offer</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>12. Business Manager Setup Advice</h2>
        <p>Even if you already have an ad account you should create a Business Manager. You can add people to your
            Business Manager account only after adding your page and ad account. You should add anyone you’d like to
            have access to your page or Ad Account here. When someone is added to the Business Manager account, they are
            defaulted to lowest-level access called employee access. This will only allow them to work on assigned
            accounts and tools. You can also add finance roles to see or edit billing info. This is usually for a
            bookkeeper or accountant. It’s always good to have an additional admin on your account in case you get
            locked out. Just make sure it’s someone you trust.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>13. Retargeting Technology & Importance (Detailed)</h2>
        <p>Retargeting technology to convert more prospects into customers: Could you imagine how excited a clothing
            retailer would be if they could place a tracking device on every person that walked into their store?
            Furthermore, what if that tracking device could also report to the shop owner every product the person
            stopped to look at, touch, and try on? Not only does this technology exist on the internet, it’s considered
            normal. Any business that does not use this will fall hopelessly behind and probably be out of business in
            short order.</p>
        <p>The technology of course is retargeting, which we’ve all seen work. You visit a product page on an ecommerce
            website and then almost instantly you see that product plastered all over your news feed for the next few
            days. This truth is well known: the bulk of your website’s visitors leave without ever engaging with you.
            They don’t fill out opt-in forms or buy anything. A study by Marketo found that 98 percent of visitors on
            your website on average are anonymous — you don’t have any information about them at all. You won’t be able
            to reach them if they leave. That’s why retargeting is important — so you can reach them even if they leave.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>14. Retargeting Best Practices & Philosophy</h2>
        <p>The smartest marketers learned to split test ads, offers, and landing pages to get the most optimal
            combination and maximise their response rate. It also perpetuated a mindset that there was an elusive
            “perfect” ad, offer, or landing page. Practically, you know that one-size-fits-all doesn’t fit your customer
            base. You have people that buy from you for all kinds of reasons because they are wired differently. It’s a
            fool’s game trying to squeeze every customer through a single portal. In reality, you need to have many
            doors for which to invite customers to walk through and begin a conversation with.</p>
        <p>As it goes, you understand that someone who visits today is more valuable than those who visit tomorrow, or
            next week, or next month. Just like the ripples in the lake, the further out from the last visit, the less
            likely that visitor will notice you. While you can define retargeting audiences from 1 to 180 days in
            Facebook, we generally recommend you set your standard audience durations to 7, 13, and 30 days. When
            creating retargeting campaigns ask yourself, “what’s the next step I’d like a visitor to do?” It’s not
            always to purchase. In your first retargeting campaign, one strategy is to provide more information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>15. ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)</h2>
        <p>Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) is a marketing metric in advertising to help you evaluate its effectiveness. Here’s
            the formula: Revenue / Cost = ROAS. A ROAS greater than 1 indicates a profit; a ROAS less than 1 indicates a
            loss.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>16. Good vs. Bad Retargeting & Zombie Ads</h2>
        <p>Clearly, retargeting is necessary and good for advertisers. Yet, we’ve all seen examples of bad and lazy
            retargeting. How about those “zombie ads” that just won’t die? You visit a site and you see the same ad
            multiple times on every website you visit or in your News Feed for months! This is a lazy and poor
            retargeting strategy. Good retargeting isn’t really remembered: it’s simply clicked on. We’re going to show
            you how to do good Facebook retargeting.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>17. How Retargeting Works (Cookies & Pixels)</h2>
        <p>Retargeting is accomplished by two main technologies: cookies and pixels. Cookies are little bits of info
            that are stored in your browser to uniquely yet anonymously identify your browser. Cookies are how Facebook
            knows you were looking at a particular page and then can allow an advertiser to show ads related to your
            visit to that site. Pixels are little bits of code on the websites you visit that set a cookie to uniquely
            tag you. Large companies like Facebook and Google (as well as many other specialized companies) use these
            pixels to “cookie” you. These major players can associate your cookie with your identity because you’re
            logged into their system. Big players don’t share your personal info with the end advertiser, so you remain
            anonymous to them. Cookies are not something you have to worry about. The pixel is something you will need
            to install on your website (more on that shortly).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>18. Retargeting Strategy Principles & Recency</h2>
        <p>There are a few best practices to help you think about how to create your Facebook retargeting strategy.
            Retargeting is very powerful for profitable advertising campaigns, but you want to be sure you follow a few
            principles to make it perform in an optimal way. As with any tool or technology, there’s a basic way to use
            it, but we want you to gain an edge over other advertisers, so we’re going to teach you what the experts
            know.</p>
        <p>People visiting your site can almost always be segmented into buyers and non-buyers. The more you can segment
            them, the more targeted your ad will be for them. Timing is everything: Do you remember what you had for
            dinner last night? Do you remember what you had for dinner two Tuesdays ago? The answer is you’d have to
            think about it to remember. That’s how your website visitors are. Within 24 to 48 hours, people have
            forgotten about you — no offense, they’re human, they are distracted. As it goes, the more recently someone
            visited your site, the more interested they are in your business. This is called recency. Facebook uses this
            idea of recency in everything they do. We generally recommend you use audiences of people that have visited
            your site in the last 1, 7, 14, and 30 days. But you can create as many as you like or need depending on
            your sales cycle. If you have a long sales cycle, using an audience that’s three times as long as your
            average sale will keep everyone engaged. So, if your average sale takes 30 days, you should use an audience
            of 90 days to ensure you include every potential buyer. Everything you do about audiences is covered in
            Chapter 5.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>19. Avoid Repetition & Use Variety</h2>
        <p>Stop repeating yourself. Most advertisers' first attempt at marketing fails because they only have one ad
            that says “Buy Now.” If someone didn’t buy on the first attempt, there are many, many possible reasons. You
            have to address those and give the visitor a good reason to come back. That reason could be more content or
            it could simply be a better deal if the price was the issue.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>20. Retargeting Is Not Just for Non-Buyers (Advanced Uses)</h2>
        <p>Retargeting is not just for non-buyers. There are many strategies where retargeting can be used other than
            convincing non-buyers to buy. For example, you can use retargeting on recent buyers and offer them an
            additional product or service — cross-sell or upsell. They are usually most likely to buy again. Often this
            is counterintuitive because you might assume they don’t need more, so try to increase your profit margin by
            asking them again — whatever every good fast food restaurant asks: “You want fries with that?”</p>
        <p>You can also target people to engage them in a series of videos or articles over the span of time as you
            learn, and you can mimic an email marketing sequence in the Facebook newsfeed without needing to capture
            their email address — which we refer to as an invisible auto-responder. You can also use retargeting to get
            people to take other actions such as liking your Facebook page, visiting your YouTube page, opting into a
            special report series, or inviting them to an exclusive event. Because the ability to track users for up to
            180 days gives you the ability to stay connected with them for six months, which is an eternity in internet
            time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>21. The Facebook Pixel – The New Way to Build a List</h2>
        <p>The Facebook pixel is the new way to build a list. I sat down with a business owner last week and he was
            talking about how he installed that pixel thing on his site and now he was waiting for all the traffic to
            show up from Facebook. He was absolutely correct in his desire to get his pixel installed, but obviously
            uninformed about how it worked.</p>
        <p>Installing your Facebook pixel is the first thing you do after setting up an account. It’s a cornerstone of
            Facebook advertising. It used to be that advertisers were obsessed with building Facebook followers with
            page likes. If you had a lot of likes you could reach those people fairly easily. However, likes are no
            longer necessary. What advertisers should be obsessed with instead is the pixel and visitors — to track and
            react to a person’s behavior. There is no need to create a robust Facebook fan page because it is much
            better to connect with the right people right in the newsfeed through content and ads.</p>
        <p>The Facebook pixel (we will also refer to it simply as the pixel in the book) is a little bit of code you put
            on your webpage to send data to Facebook about all of your visitors that Facebook matches to its users. This
            allows you to connect your website visitors to advertising on Facebook, allowing you to do two main things:
            (1) build targeting audiences and (2) measure results of your ads.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>22. Building Targeting Audiences with the Pixel</h2>
        <p>Facebook pixel allows you to build retargeting audiences based on people who visited your website — multiple
            times, specific pages, etc. A very basic targeting audience is simply one made up of everyone who visited.
            You can create multiple audiences based on specific pages they visit on your site — individual product
            pages, blog posts, checkout pages, etc. For example, someone who has added products to their shopping cart
            is much more likely to buy than someone who visited the landing page and stayed for five seconds and then
            left. So the audience of people who added a product to their cart or even started the checkout process is
            more valuable than someone who simply landed on the product detail page. Facebook helps you create the
            segments based on pages or events. Segmenting your audience by pages and events gives you time to tell a
            story and lead people through your sales process at their own pace based on their actions on your website.

        <h2>23. Installing the Facebook Pixel (Step-by-Step)</h2>
        <p>Stop what you’re doing and install the Facebook pixel right now — seriously. It’s the first thing we check
            for a new client and it’s the first thing you need to do after setting up an ad account. The first step is
            to install the pixel’s base code, which is in your Ads Manager. Then go to Events Manager and click “Add new
            data source” → Facebook Pixel. Put your website URL and Facebook will suggest a partner integration if you
            use one of the 30+ most popular website platforms like WordPress or Shopify — this is the easiest way to
            install the pixel if it applies. If you’re not using one of the partner platforms, you install the pixel
            code manually. Follow Facebook instructions to get your pixel installed. One of the questions it will ask
            you is if you want any advanced matching — yes, you should enable Advanced Matching. This is a technology
            Facebook uses in their algorithm to make cross-device conversions much easier to track. For example, many
            people discover products on their mobile device, but they buy later on their desktop. This feature helps
            know who these people are.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>24. Setting Up Events</h2>
        <p>Once the basic pixel code is installed, you can set up events. Events are simply actions a visitor takes on
            your website. It might be filling out a form with an email address, adding to shopping cart, completing a
            purchase. Facebook has the ability to optimize for any events you set up. The easiest way to set up an event
            is to use partner integration — they include the most common events that advertisers need to track or
            optimize for. To set up events yourself: go to your pixel and choose “Set up new events” from the setup menu
            in the top right corner and choose “Use Facebook Event Setup Tool.” This will allow you to set up events
            without modifying any code. Next, enter the URL of a page you would like to track events — it could be a
            landing page or product page. Then you’ll see your page with the Facebook Event Setup Tool on the top.
            Choose any buttons or links you’d like to track and they’ll be added to your events list. Any events you add
            will be available to build a retargeting audience or to optimize your ads. If you have a catalogue website
            like Shopify.com, you can connect there — that will allow you to automatically show ads for products your
            visitor looked at but may not have purchased, or even cross-sells and upsells for buyers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>25. Creating Custom Conversions</h2>
        <p>Facebook has standard conversion events that they automatically measure for you in their standard reporting:
            PageView, Lead, Purchase. Often it’s necessary to further define the final conversion when you have multiple
            events happening within your account — perhaps you have multiple lead forms being promoted at one time or
            individual order forms for various products and services. A custom conversion allows you to report and
            optimize on those specific conversion events.</p>
        <p>For example, if you are running prospecting ads and you have two ways to generate a lead — by registering for
            a webinar or by registering for a phone consult — the pixel automatically tracks leads for you. How can you
            know how many webinar registrations and phone consults the ad produced? By using a custom conversion. To
            create a custom conversion: choose Custom Conversion from the Events Manager section of your Business
            Manager. Click “Create Custom Conversion” at the top. Find the URL of the thank-you or confirmation page of
            the event you’d like to track. In the website events box, you can choose “All URL Traffic” if you’re not
            sure, or if you’re only tracking it as a standard event like Contact, Lead, Purchase, etc., choose that
            standard event based on the URL of the thank-you/confirmation page in the URL box and potentially shorten it
            to the unique part. Name your custom conversion. Assign a value — if your custom conversion is not a
            purchase, you can assign it the value of a penny, so the value is actually a count of the number of results.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>26. Verifying Your Pixel Setup</h2>
        <p>About 20 minutes after your pixel is installed you should start seeing activity on it. You should see the
            PageView events and possibly other events. If you don’t see any activity, the easiest way to troubleshoot
            your pixel is using the Facebook Pixel Helper Chrome extension from Facebook. It will allow you to see if
            your pixel is set up correctly. You can find it in the Chrome store. It will not only verify your pixel, but
            it will show your data is sent to Facebook. It will even allow you to set up custom events and link to
            analytics about your visitors. It’s something you should install to help understand the power of the pixel.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>27. Measuring Results & Optimization</h2>
        <p>Connecting your website to Facebook and retargeting closes the loop between spending money on Facebook and
            making money on your website. This is the only way to truly know which ads are working.</p>
        <p><strong>Tracking conversions</strong> — A conversion can be any activity on your website. It may be someone
            giving you an email address, purchasing a product. It might be as simple as watching a video or clicking a
            button. The conversion information is passed back to Facebook so you can see which ads are working. For
            Facebook to really optimize a conversion, it should have over 50 conversions per week. If you don’t have
            that many conversions, choose an event that’s higher up the funnel. For example, if you don’t get 50 sales a
            week, rather than optimize for a sale, optimize for an Add to Cart. Or if you don’t get 50 leads a week,
            optimize for PageView until you get up to 50 leads a week.</p>
        <p><strong>Optimize targeting</strong> — Facebook knows which people after clicking convert, so it can start
            showing similar people that convert rather than just the clickers if you’re optimizing for an event.</p>
        <p><strong>Insights about your website visitors</strong> — You can learn things about your website visitors like
            their demographics, age, location, language, gender, lifestyle, education, relationship status, job role,
            and household size. You’ll get the top few pages they like. You’ll learn about how often they log into
            Facebook and about their purchase behavior. Through the course of this book you’ll understand and appreciate
            all that Facebook will do for you — it happens with power over time.</p>

        <h2>Separating the Amateurs from the Pros: Developing Your Story</h2>

        <p>Developing your story helps visitors see you’re not boring and believe that your business is different.</p>

        <p>When you share slices of life with your audience, you will get more people following you and make it super
            simple for you to connect with your audience. People love to be connected to people who share the same

        <h3>The Headband Business Example</h3>

        <p>However, they (Band making business, small, local) had legitimate concerns, they were worried about making a
            product in their home that had no proprietary materials or technologies that would make it patentable.</p>

        <p>An enterprising company could catch on and they could easily knock them off.</p>

        <p>I remember (The Writer remembers) that call as if it were yesterday, I said: “Amy, I know this is just a
            headband and I know that there’s nothing inherently special about the material or way you make them.</p>

        <p>However I believe that you can have a successful business because we’re going to connect your product to you.
            We’re going to tell your story and we’re going to build a following of women who are just like you, and they
            will be loyal to your product and you and become champions for what you’re doing.</p>

        <p>They may try and knock off your product, but the only thing they cannot knock off is your story. No one can
            replicate your story and how this product came to light. That’s how we’re going to make this successful!”
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Why Story Wins</h3>

        <p>One of the fundamentals of story is the more you connect with people, the more they will buy your product. In
            this case, we already knew the product was good based on the feedback from their first customers. Now, all
            we had to do was tell the story and find more people like that.</p>

        <p>Stories make you immune to competition. People are going to knock off your product, but they can’t knock off
            your story.</p>

        <p>Who you are, why you do what you do, and why you created the product is really important.</p>

        <p>We spend the MOST time with our own clients diving into their story. Not nailing your story will give you
            poor results. When you find the unique story angle to connect your business to the product to the
            marketplace, you have set yourself up for success.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Story in Action: Check Company Case</h3>

        <p>When storyboarding an ad, you get someone to talk about their back story, core beliefs, and why they do what
            they do because it starts to get their mind focused on the reason that a product or service exists. It gets
            them into the mindset of how the product or service benefits the marketplace and their users. Not just
            utility.</p>

        <p>Listen, if you feel you’re too boring, find excited customers who will talk about your product. Allow them to
            tell their story about your product. Allow them to tell their story about how your product changed their
            life and you’ll begin to see common threads. The experience they have with your company will spur your inner
            storyteller.</p>

        <p>The products are beautiful, and we used stunning product imagery of their bestselling pieces to capture the
            attention of customers with facebook prospecting ads then, we retargeted them with videos that tell the
            story of the company.</p>

        <p>We chose to put the owner on camera to tell his story. We added personal connections to his business. No
            other check company was doing that. He was able to talk about the “elephant in the room” where the same
            checks you buy from your bank are ten times the price he sells them for. “Banks are ripping you off, there’s
            a better way.”</p>

        <p>We not only target potential customers; we have an extensive retargeting strategy to tell this story to folks
            who google his business and come via organic and paid campaigns.</p>

        <h3>Customer Behavior & Audience Targeting</h3>

        <p>You customers will act in the same way. As you begin this chapter talking about audiences, it’s helpful to
            know that there are customers that prefer to be pushed. And some prefer to be pulled. A good advertiser will
            understand their audience so well that their ads perfectly align with how their customers desire to be led.
        </p>

        <p>To be a successful facebook advertiser, you need to identify the MOST likely prospects for your service or
            product because your budget has limits. You must understand Who is the perfect person to buy from you.</p>

        <p>There are four types of audience targeting:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Custom audiences that are created by user’s activity both on and off facebook</li>
            <li>Demographics including age, gender, language, and location.</li>
            <li>Detailed targeting using additional Facebook demographics, interests and behaviors.</li>
            <li>Connections of people who like your page, event or app and their friends.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Targeting Hierarchy (Priority)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Customers using a Custom audience</li>
            <li>Unconverted Leads/Prospects using a Custom audience.</li>
            <li>Engagements using a custom audience</li>
            <li>Compiled lists using a custom audience</li>
            <li>Lookalikes</li>
            <li>Interest detail targeting</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <!-- Continue with the rest of the custom audiences, RFM, lookalikes, etc., in similar structured blocks if you want to split further -->

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Custom Audience Sources</h3>

        <p>There are ten sources to create custom audiences. The first four are derived from your sources:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>An uploaded list of customers or prospects called a Customer File</li>
            <li>Website Traffic using the Facebook Pixel</li>
            <li>Activity form Mobile Apps that use Facebook’s plugin (called SDK)</li>
            <li>An uploaded List of Offline Activity</li>
        </ol>

        <p>These audiences can come from your website, shopping cart, customer relations management (CRM) software, app,
            or even other businesses. When you upload your list, Facebook will attempt to match the people in your list
            to its users and allow you to advertise to them.</p>

        <p>The other six are custom audience sources derived from Facebook:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Video Engagement.</li>
            <li>Lead Forms</li>
            <li>Instant Experiences</li>
            <li>Your facebook Events</li>
            <li>Your facebook Page</li>
            <li>Your instagram business profile</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Other than the customer file and uploaded list of offline activity, all of these audiences are dynamic, that
            means people will be automatically added when they perform an action and removed from the audience after a
            timeframe you specify. Let’s dive into all ten.</p>
