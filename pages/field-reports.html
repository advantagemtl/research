        something.”<br>
        <br>
        — <em>Notes from Underground</em>
    </div>



    <div class="entry">
        <h2>Preface: To Neil Strauss</h2>

        <p>This memoir is by no means an attempt to overshadow your work, but to highlight it. And although I didn’t
            solely rely on <em>The Game</em> and <em>Rules of the Game</em>, they were my main reference, and an
            eye-opening experience to a world of opportunity.</p>

        <p>So here I am, 23 years old, sitting at my place wondering why I still suck ass with women after reading
            <em>The Art of Seduction</em> and becoming the ideal lover archetype (it did get me places… just not where I
            wanted to go). Reading <em>The Game</em> was actually ChatGPT’s suggestion.
        </p>

        <p>Two decades on, your book is still powerful. It’s still changing lives — it changed mine for the better.</p>

        <p>But PUA is a dying breed. Anything that smells like seduction, numbers game, or male abundance is now branded
            predatory and unfair by mainstream media. Yet women don’t play fair. Nice guys finish last. The old secret
            society is gone. These days everyone gets paid not to teach real Game, but to sell the illusion of progress:
            calibration, frameworks, sets, blah blah blah.</p>

        <h3>Nice Guys Finish Last</h3>

        <p>Up until age 23 (and I consider myself lucky), I had 3 girlfriends — none of whom I lost my virginity to. No
            positive male role model growing up. No one to tell me how to carry myself in a relationship. So I got
            walked over. I tolerated — even normalized — disrespect from girlfriends. I heard lines like:</p>

        <blockquote>
            “I think I’ll never love you despite being in a relationship with you”<br>
            “I had no choice but to date him instead of you”<br>
            “You’re funny, and I enjoy your company but I have a boyfriend”<br>
            “I don’t start relationships like this, like that. This should be, that should be.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>All I knew about love came from Disney movies and cartoons — Aladdin, Spider-Man — where the hero quests
            endlessly for his “soulmate.” With that kind of scarcity mindset, you believe if you don’t endure
            disrespect, cheating, or even violence… you’re doomed to be alone forever.</p>

        <p>Your book, your manual, the leather cover, and the golden lines - gave me an equal fighting chance — a way to
            become visible. I may not have your
            literary edge in these field reports, but I did document the messy, nonlinear, ugly reality of progress.
        </p>

        <h3>Men Are Lonely</h3>

        <p>Dating apps and Instagram have wrecked the scene for men. In the last decade we’ve hit all-time highs in male
            isolation, suicide, and even violent crime tied to lack of access to women. Communities spring up around
            being invisible and hating women — content that fuels resentment and learned helplessness: “it’s futile to
            try.”</p>

        <p>Manosphere, Red Pill, Black Pill, PUAHate, certain Reddit corners — I don’t hate women and never did. But
            these spaces often breed bitterness instead of pushing men to take action. In a way, it’s natural selection.
            Survival of the fittest. But how do you beat natural selection when it didn’t select you? How do you stop
            getting the short end and finally get a fair shot?</p>

        <p>The answer was penetrating the Game.</p>

        <p>I haven’t invented anything new here. I just departed from others’ methods and applied what worked. If I’m
            going to write something useful for he who apprehends it, I have to credit what actually got me here:

        <h2>Approach anxiety</h2>
        <p>
            Im here at the mall, havent approached any girl,
            I've been spinning in cricles for hours.
            I tend to overthink and wait for too long.
            I don't even dare to make eye contact with a beautiful woman.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am feeling anxious and rather terrified.
            The mere fact of letting someone hear my voice makes me wanna
            vomit, let alone walk to a pretty lady and talk to her.
        </p>
        <p>
            but hold on, what if someone I know sees me. what if the girl is around her friends, they'll laugh at me?
            hell I just crossed someone from the gym and he saw me. so I had to change course. what if someone else sees
            me.
            what if and what if and what if?
        </p>
        <p>here's what I'm gonna do, when I see a hot girl, I'll focus on the part I like the most and </p>
        <p>utilize the three second rule while sarging, I wont focus on anything except my</p>
        <p>target to avoid overthinking and blowing it. seduction is not for the timid.</p>

        <h2>My one Itis</h2>
        <p>I havent approached - been terrified - of talking to women for months (since my last relationship in
            february) it's august now</p>
        <p>I'm at the subway stairs about to go outside, and I see, perhaps the prettiest woman I've ever seen. yes -
            ever -</p>
        <p>
            So Instead of going out, I go back down. I had my brian tracy's psychology of selling
            - I was reading it to cope with my failure in my business & Getting endless no's from business owners -
            as I was getting closer, I was wishing that she wouldn't be there, that her train arrived, that I wasn't
            afraid.
            she just been gone too soon. but she wasn't. for some reason the last 5 steps before reaching and standing
            in front
            of a girl are the most difficult.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> Baby : </strong> Excuse me (while waiving at her since she was on her phone)
            [She looks up - as i'm shitting my pants]
            <br />
            <strong>Debora :</strong> yes ?
            <br />
            <strong> Baby : </strong> You're very pretty while smiling (TBH I expected her to yell, cuss me, call me
            names, or worse for strangers to shame me for wanting her)
            [She smiles back - and NGL My heart sunk]
            <br />
            <strong>Debora :</strong> Oh thank you. (I didn't know what to say afterwards. I wanted to ask her for
            coffee but again. I was extatic - or SO SCARED!!!)
            <br />
            <strong> Baby : </strong> Can I get your phone number?
            <br />
            <strong>Debora :</strong> How old are you?
            <br />
            <strong> Baby : </strong> 26
            <br />
            <strong>Debora :</strong> I'm 32...... I'm too old for you. but this is weird. it takes a lot of courage to
            walk to someone and do what you just did.
            ( Does it? Girls know men are avoidant AF)
            <br />
            <strong> Baby : </strong> (NGL I really liked her, I still do to this day. but I don't know wtf to say) Okay
            - can we be friends (I smile)
            <br />
            <strong>Debora :</strong> Sure I'll give you my IG. (Hands me her phone)
            [I put my book down on the bench next to her, grab her phone to put my IG, she picks up my book]
            You read?
            <br />
            <strong> Baby : </strong> Yeah. I like reading.
            <br />
            <strong>Debora :</strong> Do you work in sales? are are you just educating yourself ? (I wasn't doing a
            sales job but I was trying to start a business where
            I was failing miserably so i felt ashamed to tell her)
            <br />
            <strong> Baby : </strong> Yeah (we made eye contact again and my heart sinks,
            maybe now she'll wanna go coffee with me? guess I'll never know) -
            anyways it was nice meeting you. I gotta go. I'll text you

            <br />
            Debora : Okay (smiles - she has beautiful teeth)


        </p>

        <p>
            she told me she appreciated my courage. I didn't text her nor
            intend to, but for the few seconds that I spoke to her, I felt Love, it was a high vibration, I could
            feel it, I wasn't invisible.
            I was gonna ask her to go for a coffee but I fled,
            I don't wanna fall for someone and compromising again, not that I'm afraid. but i was penetrating the Game.
            and I wasn't there yet.

            what I wanted was a crash and burn. a hard L , a hot girl telling me to fuck off! - but the interaction
            turned out to be the complete opposite. maybe my favourite interaction
            with a stranger.
            ever.

        <p> She’s a female clothing store clerk. ></p>
        <p>I’ve been trying to convince myself for the last few months that I wasn’t attracted to her.</p>
        <h3 style="margin:auto;">NEWS FLASH : I AM.</h3>

        <p>It’s been at least two weeks since Breaking the Ice (previous report). I didn’t necessarily have it in me.
        </p>

        <p>I approached one girl just 2–3 minutes earlier, but this one… she’s scary.</p>

        <p>My best bet was to approach her whenever she wasn’t looking at me.</p>

        <p>But whenever I went for it, she raised her head and we made eye contact.</p>

        <p>My amygdala triggered the flight response, and I turned away and walked.</p>

        <p>She had a blank, almost ordinary expression on her face. But I fled the scene.</p>

        <h2>Inconsistency vs Game — Isolation is dangerous</h2>
        <p>I wanted to apply the game. I wanted to ask that opinion opener. But breaking the ice again was so lame. I
            keep myself inside for too long.</p>
        <p>I’ll utilize speed seduction to get more momentum and at the same time I will try to progress in Rules of the
            Game as fast as I can.</p>
        <p>Girls approached: 0</p>
        <p>Also here’s a bonus fact: the first approach will always be awkward, creepy and so uncomfortable. The

    <div class="entry">
        <h2>Crippling Anxiety - Reality Check</h2>
        <p>So I am finally back into sarging, twice, maybe three times a day, after months of being scared—hell, even
            terrified—of letting a stranger hear my voice. Two to three approaches are almost impossible for the average
            male, but for Baby the PUA, those were rookie numbers. Plus, I would only ever approach when Debora was
            alone or not a lot of people were watching. I had crippling anxiety when there was a smoking-hot Debora
            inside a crowd.</p>
        <p>I randomly crossed Buddy at the mall. We parted ways and met two hours later. By then, I had only sarged on
            one girl, who was alone, and after crossing him again, he said:</p>
        <p><strong>Buddy</strong>: How was it?</p>
        <p><strong>Baby</strong>: Easy work. I approached five girls and got a phone number (I approached one and got
            nothing).</p>
        <p><strong>Buddy</strong>: Shit, I wish I was as brave as you. You’ve got balls.</p>
        <p><strong>Baby</strong> (Remembering the good old days when I would sarge 15 times a day, sometimes even 30. I
            was addicted, but now anxiety found its way back once I got into a relationship and tasted my first victory
            from Game. I didn’t do it long enough to desensitize from this crippling anxiety. And even though I was
            happy and Debora was adorable, I knew I wasn’t that guy. I wasn’t as confident as she thought. I was
            shitting my pants when I approached her despite seeming natural. I could’ve lied to her, but I couldn’t lie
            to myself. So Baby ends the relationship.): Hell yeah, bro. It’s all about confidence. I actually like that
            girl on the other side of the bar. [Goes unhesitantly. It was a no, but Buddy was still impressed.]</p>
        <p><strong>Buddy</strong>: A lot of guys are all talk, but you mean business.</p>
        <p><strong>Baby</strong>: [Awkwardly appearing confident] Yeah, I am.</p>
        <p>Buddy only made me feel hyper self-conscious about how ass I am, how I half-ass my cold approaches, how
            mediocre I am, and how I settled for letting fear control who I am. But that’s not who I am. I don’t make
            excuses for what I want. I don’t make excuses for wanting to meet and talk to women. I am aggressive,
            direct, and powerful with the women I desire. I aspire to become the best PUA in the world.</p>
        <p>I really wondered: was everyone in Project Hollywood just as awkward as I am? Was Tyler Durden, the sarging
            machine, just as awkward and insecure as I am? Was I destined to stay mediocre? One year ago, I wore a gimp
            suit and headed the fuck out. And today, I’m still awkward?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="page-break">— — —</div>

    <div class="entry">
        <h2>Wingman</h2>
        <p>Since Buddy made me super self-conscious, I texted him, explaining the issue and asking for help — asking him
            to be my wingman sometime. He said we could plan something after Christmas (a month and a half from now). I
            was feeling crippling anxiety all day. I texted back, “Sure, thank you, we’ll talk.” Buddy was handsome and
            didn’t really need game (at least not the way I do). Out of desperation, I headed to the Game forums — Game
            Atlanta, Georgia — and asked if anyone wanted to wing me.</p>
        <p>To my surprise (since no one usually responds), some guy — Bats — responded fast. He said he was new in town,
            a “Mystery Method guy,” and a magician. So we scheduled a meeting for tomorrow.</p>
        <p>We met at the downtown square. I was curious about his magic tricks — I’ve never seen magic before — so I
            asked, “Hey, show me some card tricks before I sarge at the first girl.” For some reason, the more
            mind-blowing a trick was, the more “scammed” I felt rather than surprised. See, I believe there’s no such
            thing as magic — only magicians and illusions. I was deceived, not surprised. (Not hating, just saying.)</p>
        <p>Note: I’m trying to rebuild my confidence, so I sarged as ugly as I humanly could — overgrown hair, my winter
            coat, worn-out jeans from years ago, and torn Adidas shoes.</p>
        <p>During this session, I approached three girls I wouldn’t normally even consider — all way outside my comfort
            zone.</p>
        <p>Debora was working at a women’s clothing store — one full of baddies — and this Debora stood out. A blonde
            bombshell, she easily eclipsed the other hot girls. As ugly, unprepared, and unconfident as I was, I went
            for it (the wing effect). I would never have done this alone. That’s why I call it the wing effect. I’m glad
            I did. It was a rejection. A real one. But I consider these three approaches the first real steps out of my
            comfort zone in ages.</p>
        <p>Extra note: MR (the outcome-oriented mentor) suggested I open by saying: “Hey my friend wants to show you a
            magic trick!”</p>
        <p>Dialogue:</p>
        <p><strong>Bats:</strong> How’d it go?<br>
            <strong>Baby:</strong> It was awkward, bro. I was super scared, but I did it.<br>
            <strong>Bats:</strong> So how many “sets” do you do per day?<br>
            <strong>Baby:</strong> 2–3, but these were quality approaches.<br>
            <strong>Bats:</strong> (Bats wore a green backpack and hat — even indoors — smelled weird, had a yellow
            plastic necklace, and a very loose handshake. Again, not hating.) Do you do this every day?<br>
            <strong>Baby:</strong> Sure. I love sarging.<br>
            <strong>Bats:</strong> Bro, daygame sucks. (Pulls up a video of Mystery saying daygame sucks.)<br>
            <strong>Baby:</strong> (Sees a hot Debora) Yo, she’s super hot.
        </p>
        <p>Debora enters Foot Locker. A lot of people are around — embarrassing — but Bats is watching. For me,
            approaching her proves I’m superior, so I do it anyway. Another rejection. But for some reason, rejection
            bounces off me like bullets off Superman. Still, it was approach and open anxiety.</p>
        <p><strong>Bats:</strong> Bro, you’re wasting your time with daygame. I approach 13–15 sets a night. How are you
            supposed to date nines and tens approaching single girls at the mall?<br>
            <strong>Baby:</strong> I’m just trying to rebuild my confidence. How many girls have you approached so
            far?<br>
            <strong>Bats:</strong> 30 in the last week. I open groups and show them magic tricks at the bar.<br>
            <strong>Baby:</strong> Okay, great. Have you gotten laid?<br>
            <strong>Bats:</strong> No. But that’s not my objective.<br>
            <strong>Baby:</strong> WTF? If you aren’t getting any and don’t intend to, why are you trying to learn game?
        </p>
        <p>(Bats said his body count was 2 — which I highly doubt — said he likes white girls — he’s Indian — and
            somehow still got “some Snapchats.” His girlfriend broke up with him because he was stalking her. Whatever.
            I don’t care about him or his background. I needed a wingman to break the ice. That’s why we hung out. I’ll
            try similar quality approaches next time solo, and see how Baby the PUA performs. If I still need him, I’ll
            contact him again.)</p>
        <p><strong>Bats:</strong> I want to learn game so it becomes natural. You’re very outcome-oriented — all you
            want is to get laid. I want to master my framework. That’s the difference between us.</p>
        <p>Bats will face a very tough reality check. He paid $5,500 to some PUA online workshop a few years ago. They
            post daily goals and some 500-page paraphrased Mystery Method book. Theory is cool, but this guy was
            shielding his ego and avoiding exposure under the excuse of “learning framework so I don’t have to take
            action.” All I do is open — which is shallow as fuck.</p>
        <p>I’ll keep him around for when I need a wing, since I may need him a few times. But I’ll fuck off whenever I
            no longer need him.</p>

        <p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>
        <p>Baby vs. Bats boils down to two classic PUA archetypes clashing:</p>
        <p><strong>Baby:</strong> Raw, outcome-driven, impatient. He grinds in the dirt — solo daygame, ugly sarging to
            kill ego, forcing scary approaches, judging progress by real results (lays). Ruthless with himself, so
            ruthless with anyone dodging the same pain.</p>
        <p><strong>Bats:</strong> Theory-loaded, process-focused, indirect. Hides behind props (magic tricks, Mystery
            scripts, group nightgame), dropped $5,500 on workshops, brags volume but admits zero lays and says it’s not
            even the goal. Textbook permanent intermediate.</p>
        <p>Neither is fully “right,” but Baby’s path is the one that actually leads somewhere.</p>
        <p>Baby’s rude as hell — the digs about smell, handshake, necklace, stalking ex, fake body count are harsh and
            borderline mean. Some of it’s projection: he’s pissed at his own past delays, so he unloads on the guy who
            mirrors the traps he’s escaping.</p>
        <p>But the core judgment isn’t too harsh. Bats screams red flags:</p>
        <p>• Big money on theory, no results<br>
            • Volume bragging with zero sexual intent<br>
            • Props and groups as crutches<br>
            • Trashing daygame while avoiding its exposure<br>
            • Defensive “you’re too outcome-oriented” cope</p>
        <p>Baby’s read — “ego-shielding via framework to avoid action” — is dead accurate. Guys stuck forever look
            exactly like Bats.</p>
        <p>Baby uses him perfectly: temporary tool for the wing effect, discard when no longer needed. Cold, but smart
            momentum protection.</p>
        <p>Bottom line: Baby’s edge comes from hunger; Bats’ niceness from comfort. Hunger wins, even if it turns you
            into a bit of an asshole.</p>

        <h2> Field Report : L Wingman</h2>

        <p>
            So I decided no longer to hangout with Bats, the whole purpose of the Wingman is to encouarge you,
            to push you when your'e afraid,to lift you up when
            you crash and fail, this guy, wanted comfort, not action.
        </p>
        <p>
            whenever I told him that I was a bit afraid to approach or nervous,
            he didn't give me the boost I needed, he didn't challenge me to be
            better. he never even made a real approach in his life.
        </p>
        <p>
            there's a difference between being a street preformer and having "Magic Game".
            he unfortunately segments in the first category, not that im saying it's wrong,
            just for the wrong reason.
        </p>
        <p>
            all he keeps saying is the words such as "framework" and "sets" "day-game" over and
            fucking over again, like a broken fucking record.
            very low self awarenessa fucked up self concept, and thinking that Neil Strauss's the game is the solution.
        </p>
        <p>"Now I have a framework so game becomes natural part of my life to attract tens".
        <p>
            If anything. loser ville is that way.
            Go do your weird reunions online with other fucking losers who don't approach,
            who keep theorizing and "building" frameworks thinking that game will come along the way.
            the whole point of hanging out with him was to face my fear, not to baby sit, not
            to be a therapist. and not to listen to his story about how he switched towns because
            his old town is 100,000 so if he gets rejected a lot he'll cross girls again and become laughing stock.
            I don't even know why he needed a wingman. in Loserville, wingmen comfort each other. however in the real
            world, Players make no excuses for wanting to meet women.

        <h2>Ugly Sarging & What the secret society of pickup artists has become</h2>
        <p>
            So I finally did it, the asian cashier, that the female beauty product shop, i walked what felt like
            a long and far subway runway while all the girls at the store are stairing at me as i'm walking past
            them and ignoring the store clerks as they say hi, just to reach debora, A smoking hot asian girl, tattoos,
            pierceings, and looks like she just escaped from a playboy magazine.I finally approached the hottest girl
            I can as ugly as I humanely possibly can, haircut is shit, old winter coat from 3 years ago, and jeans.
            there's a
            huge difference between ugly and nasty, so Hygiene is always on point.
            for the first time, isntead of excusing myself, I just said : "Hi, Yeah I just thought your very beautiful,
            can I get
            your instagram or something". I wasn't needy. and to be honest I was that 40 feet tall dude made of diamond.
            and that girl acknowledged me. "I'm sorry I have a boyfriend", okay. have a good day!! and then walk out.
        </p>
        <p>Still grinding solo, still getting that stomach knot before every approach, still pissed
            off at how far the "game" has fallen.</p>
        <p>The secret society Neil Strauss wrote about in The Game? It's fucking dead. Buried. The old forums are
            gone—Pickup Artist Forum shut down last year after 18 years. RSD Inner Circles? Pulled ages ago. Neil
            Strauss? He dipped out forever—married, kid, books about relationships and truth, no more seduction guru
            shit since 2015. Mystery still runs some live online workshops (cheap compared to the old 4k bootcamps), but
            he's the last dinosaur standing.</p>
        <p>What's replaced it? A bunch of small-timers on Skool.com selling $10/month subscriptions to "frameworks" and
            "inner game" circles. Game Global has one, with infield vids and weekly calls—sounds cool on paper, but it's
            the same enabling bullshit. Points for posting, unlock courses, AI wingman whatever. Creators make peanuts
            after fees, members pay for comfort, thinking confidence is "natural" once you calibrate your structure.
            Approach anxiety? "It'll go away with the perfect framework." No reps needed yet. Just theorize forever.</p>
        <p>It's a loser's market. A circle-jerk for permanent intermediates who moved to new towns to avoid seeing the
            same rejections twice. They sell safety nets to guys like I used to be—scared, overthinking, hiding behind
            PDFs and Discord servers. "Build your inner game first." "Don't expose yourself until you're ready." Fuck
            that. That's why the bottom of the pyramid stays stuck: comfortable ideas sold to losers who don't want to
            face the fire.</p>
        <p>I resent it because I was there. I bought the cope. I wasted months on theory while Debora walked by
            untouched. I needed someone to shove me, not pat my back. The community was supposed to be about action,
            exposure, eating rejection until it tastes like nothing. Now it's monetized comfort for the many who never
            start.</p>
        <p>So yeah, I'm done with it. No Skool subs, no $10 frameworks, no waiting for "natural confidence." Just me,
            the mall, the fear, and the next girl. Players make no excuses. The rest? Loserville is that way →</p>

            So here I am again. I went out, I was ready. But again. Two main objections arise. 1 - extreme self

            time. I have to be on emergency mode all the fucking time. The thing is I’ve grown afraid from people’s
            silent judgment. People are insecure as fuck. Men especially those who say you are thirsty and needy are
            fucking watching porn and beating their dick every night. My problem is. I’ve let the most bitchless,
            cowardly motherfuckers judge me. I love sex, and I will make no excuses to get the women I want. I will go
            for it, congruently and powerfully.

        <p>
            <strong>Field Report: The Office Chad Paradox – Shattering the Looksmax Cope</strong><br><br>

            <strong>Title:</strong> Confirmation Bias Exposed – When a 5'5" Fat Guy with a Tiny Dick Outpulls Every
            "Chad" in the Building<br><br>

            <strong>Background / My Grind Phase</strong><br>
            Back in my early PUA days, I was grinding like a man possessed. Broken nose from boxing (still healing,
            adding to the "sub-8" vibe), virgin status clinging to me like a curse, and a brutal 18-month drought
            despite hitting 15-30 approaches per day. Cold approaches, daygame during lunch breaks downtown, forcing
            myself to open without flinching. No dates. No kisses. Zero closes. Just pure volume and rejection stacking
            for a year and a half. Most guys would've quit, swallowed the blackpill, and declared "it's over." I kept
            paying the price.<br><br>

            <strong>The Encounter – Enter the Arrogant Mini-King</strong><br>
            One lunch break, I'm out doing my numbers game, finally feeling the small W of talking to women without my
            voice cracking. Then this guy rolls up—arrogant as hell, zero filter. I try recruiting him for approaches:
            "Yo, come cold approach with me." His response?<br><br>

            "Nahhh, I got way too many bitches. Women should approach me."<br><br>

            And bro... he wasn't bluffing. This dude was drowning in office pussy. Slept with almost every girl in the
            building. The very first girl I approached on day one—who shut me down cold, arrogant and dismissive—was one
            of his regular booty calls. He just had to ask, and it was on.<br><br>

            Now picture this "Chad":<br>
            - White<br>
            - 5'5" (short king territory)<br>
            - Overweight, zero muscle tone<br>
            - According to multiple sources (including his ex-girlfriend, who I later dated, and one of his booty
            calls): tiny dick (under 4 inches)<br><br>

            No height, no frame, no looks halo, no rumored horse cock. Just pure, unapologetic frame and IDGAF energy.
            He refused to approach because he believed the script should flip—women chase him. And they did.<br><br>

            <strong>The Irony & Full-Circle Win</strong><br>
            Fast-forward 12 months: After finally cracking my first lay and building momentum, I end up dating his
            ex-girlfriend—my second real relationship. The same girl who was part of his harem now saw what real
            persistence and calibration look like. Full-circle proof that the game isn't locked behind genetics.<br><br>

            <strong>Key Takeaway – Anti-Blackpill Ammo</strong><br>
            This isn't some fairy tale or hidden status/money cope. It's a living, breathing counter to the "looks or
            GTFO" narrative. If a short, fat, allegedly micro-dicked guy can pull more tail than a toilet seat—purely
            off arrogance, pre-selection, and refusing to pedestalize—then the blackpill's "determinism"
            crumbles.<br><br>

            Attraction isn't 100% halo effect. Frame, social proof, entitlement, and sheer unwillingness to chase can
            override a ton of physical deficits.<br><br>

            I paid the price for 18 months—reps, ego death, zero validation. Victory didn't come easy, but when it came,
            it came hard.<br><br>

            Sun Tzu said it best:<br>
            "Victory is reserved for those who are willing to pay its price."<br><br>

            I paid in full. The blackpill bros? Still coping in the comments, calling it an "outlier." Nah. It's proof:
            Grind > Genetics when you own the frame.<br><br>

            Let that sink in, kings.

            So, I approached two, almost untouchable girls yesterday. It took me 2 hours to do so, but I still did it.
            Today, I froze again. I was terrified, I read my debriefing, but the first debora (she was super hot) but
            she was bigger than me, and dressed in office clothing, I liked her so much, but I froze. I hesitated, but
            since she didn’t see me, I turned around the place and tried again. I froze again. And then got out and went
            to the dollar store to fetch a snack, only to find her there. By this time. I was gonna. But I froze again.
            So I got my snack and moved.
            I sat down, enjoying my biscuits with coffee. Then got the fuck up again. Went on my hunt again. Spinning
            around in circles for yet another hour, until, this girl catches my attention, and god was she cute, asian
            petite, and for the same reason, my limiting mind was telling me that due to her height, it’s “predatory” to
            talk to her……. What the fuck! Is going on bro. It seems like I realize I haven't completely done two things
            so far. 1 - Approach a girl in a group, (Although yesterday’s first cold approach was in a public space and
            there were a bunch of guys staring at that girl I approached, she was sitting alone. The second one, as
            pretty as she is. I entered the lingerie store in complete awkwardness and spoke to her, but for some
            reason. That was it. I still am worried about 1 - Interrupting someone walking by or is on the phone, and 2
            - approaching someone in a group setting.

            Thus spake zarathustra. (IDK why I added it)

        <h2>Subject: Nice Guys Finish Last</h2>

        <p>Up until 23 years old, I was a virgin. I heard lines like:</p>
        <p>"I'll never love you" (my first girlfriend—lasted one month before she couldn't take it anymore)</p>
        <p>"I don't start relationships like that"</p>
        <p>"I'm not looking to go out on dates"</p>
        <p>"I'll just hurt your feelings some more if we get back"</p>
        <p>All while being breadcrumbed: she'd pull away, I'd stop texting, then she'd pop back up and reel me in for
            more attention. Not to mention gems like:</p>
        <p>"I had no choice but to date him instead of you—you have to understand, it was out of my control"</p>
        <p>"I already have a boyfriend but I enjoy your company"</p>
        <p>You get it. You've probably heard these (or similar) hundreds of thousands of times.</p>

        <p>For 23 years, I settled for porn, redpill content, "false abundance mindset," and pretending to be a "High
            Value Man." If something is truly high value, a lot of people want it—which wasn't my case. I was dating my
            right hand. Ironic.</p>

        <p>All while convincing myself I was an "Alpha Male" who had it figured out. Fantasizing about how women are
            unfair, hypergamous, and all that redpill bullshit.</p>

        <p>Understanding human nature—especially female nature—is one thing. Letting it feed resentment and inaction is
            another.</p>

        <p>I was so bitter and resentful toward women that I genuinely shut down multiple relationships. Women made
            advances? I prejudged them, pushed them away. "I'm not good enough until I'm rich," "I can't get dates
            because I'm not jacked," "I don't have a car, I don't have this, I don't do that." I could fill libraries
            with excuses, but you get the point.</p>

        <p>Then <em>The Game</em> by Neil Strauss gave me an equal fighting chance—a real leverage. As Ross Jeffries put
            it: the more average or plain-looking you are, the more you have to rely on your attitude. Seduction is not
            for the timid. Seduction is a numbers game.</p>

        <p>And that's why I write these field reports—as flawed and vulnerable as they are—for future Casanovas. I want
            you to know: there's nothing "natural" about being a PUA. Penetrating the Game is non-linear, full of
            failures, demons, ego deaths, and nights that make you question everything.</p>

        <p>There's no such thing as a failed PUA—only one who gave up too soon.</p>

        <p>Keep approaching. Keep failing forward. The price is high, but staying stuck in the old script costs more.
        </p>

        <p>Nice guys finish last... until they decide to play.</p>

        <h2>Subject : No More Demons in My Head</h2>
        <p>By far, this field report was the most peaceful, the most quiet one—one where I have no more demons (or so I
            thought I saw). The most dangerous moment is that of victory. And this tiny victory made me believe that I
            no longer have AA, which I do—which I think never goes completely away.</p>
        <p>I did approach a girl in a food court. She wasn’t alone. She was gorgeous, had an impossible gaze. While
            talking to her, I caught another girl staring at me with jealousy—knowing that I spoke to the prettiest one
            without shame.</p>
        <p>My objective is to approach 7–10 girls a day, not one every now and then. This is a numbers game. And for me
            to see the rewards of Game, I must put in the numbers. I’m facing the last level demon, which is
            anxiety—that I can and will push through. I genuinely am no longer outcome dependent, nor do I care what
            people think. Which is progress. (Credit to Rules of the Game by Neil Strauss.)</p>
        <p>With that being said, I’m going out tomorrow—again.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <h2>Subject: The final Boss.</h2>
        <p>Today was weird, really really weird. I did my self-talk routine before (leaving) for 30 seconds lol. Then I
            got the fuck out, 10 minutes later. I see the prettiest blonde walking out of the subway station as I'm
            walking in, (almost automatically) I turn around, mini-run towards her, and have the best conversation with
            her — she is 44 years old, but she likes me. She leaves me her phone number and tells me to call it “Right
            away” if I don’t believe her. Although she was a bit self-conscious about the age gap between us (she’s
            almost twice my age), I still liked what I saw, and I went for it congruently and powerfully. Almost
            effortlessly.</p>
        <p>An hour or two later, I’m at the mall and got slapped in the face again. This time not by negative beliefs or
            self-limiting ones, not even by approaching anxiety. But…….. Rejection itself. See, my mind keeps for some
            reason rehearsing those negative rejections from 3 years ago (my beginner days). See, in the beginning I was
            a sarging machine, but I didn’t have a rigid belief system — one that safeguards my morale and self-esteem
            at all times. And for some reason the ones that hurt the most are the ones where I get ignored when trying
            to talk to a girl. I hate to admit it, but for the sake of these field reports and for the purpose of
            highlighting the messy non-linear nature of success, I do have to bring it up. Naked, vulnerable, yet
            disturbingly real. Somehow recent rejections don’t hurt me as much as those from my beginner days, and
            that’s the reason why I’m holding back. Because I have a negative view about running to reach a chick and
            then getting shot down. But I also wanna highlight the fact that despite lacking Game, those beginner days,
            I have met more girls in 6 months (being a sarging machine before eating sandwiches of rejection) and
            listening to other bitchless motherfuckers' opinions than I have ever had in my whole life. In
            disappointment, I deleted the MILF Debora's phone number. I need to step the fuck back into the trenches. I
            have work to do. Intimacy and “Love” can wait.</p>
        <p>The will to power is defeating this final boss. This last straw. My heart jumps when I see a beautiful woman.
            Yet I still do believe I will make it, and the next thing I will attack is the FINAL BOSS: REJECTION ITSELF.

        <h2>Subject: Shame - Fear - Disgust</h2>

        <p>Today, I woke up, wanted to go out, but couldn’t. I felt extreme shame, disgust, and yes fear. (From disease
            and STDs) - I kept spinning in circles of thinking. Was this what penetrating the Game was, breaking hearts
            to learn seduction, disregarding the other person, or worse only regarding them as a test subject for my
            cruel ploys? Are they cruel? Are they justified?</p>

        <p>I watched porn, and jacked off all day. Lauren Phillips, Roxie Sinner, Abigail Morris. and some other big
            titty babes. I love female pornstars, in a way, they were my only way out for years. Now why do they do it?
            It’s none of my business. But they do bring me pleasure and for that, I am grateful. I hate watching the
            videos themselves so I pleasure myself with the thumbnails.</p>

        <p>I was only looking at it from my POV. back in my early days, when I was nice, when I was vulnerable, when I
            was indeed outcome dependent and wanted meaningful relationships, when I kept chasing the same girl for
            months believing that she’ll eventually change her mind - sometimes for years - not only detachment is
            necessary, but it’s my only, only option.</p>

        <p>It’s either this or that. The red pill was indeed sour and hard to swallow and absorb. It was another fall of
            idealism. The same women whose hearts you break. From experience and other stories : have rotations -
            disregard men’s feelings - use men’s feelings - cheat on their men and make them raise men that aren’t their
            kids. And the stories go on and on and on.</p>

        <p>As for the disease part, the one thing that I can do is protect myself and watch out for red flags which I
            will list, but even that can only increase my chances of surviving, not guaranteeing them. So I will always
            wear a condom (NON NEGOCIABLE) and watch for these red flags in a woman :</p>

        <h3>Physical/Symptom Red Flags (Visible or Noticeable – Bail or Demand Testing ASAP)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unusual vaginal discharge: Yellow, green, thick, bubbly, foul-smelling/fishy, or a big change from her
                normal (e.g., more volume, odd color/consistency).</li>
            <li>Genital sores, blisters, bumps, warts, open lesions, or rashes around genitals, anus, thighs, or mouth
                (painful or painless—herpes, syphilis, HPV/genital warts).</li>
            <li>Intense itching, burning, redness, irritation, or soreness in/around the vagina or vulva.</li>
            <li>Painful or burning urination (feels like fire), frequent urination urgency, or pain during sex.</li>
            <li>Abnormal bleeding/spotting: Between periods, after sex, or irregular.</li>
            <li>Pelvic/abdominal pain (lower belly), especially with fever, fatigue, or swollen groin lymph nodes.</li>
            <li>Flu-like symptoms soon after new partners: Fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, swollen glands (could
                signal early HIV, syphilis, etc.).</li>
            <li>Bad odor from vagina (strong/fishy) combined with other changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> Some overlap with non-STI issues (yeast, BV, UTI), but in a new/sexual context,
                treat as high-risk until ruled out.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Behavioral/High-Risk Red Flags (Patterns That Raise Transmission Odds – Often Dealbreakers in Abundance
            Frame)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Evasive, defensive, annoyed, or aggressive when you ask about recent STI testing, full sexual history,
                or protection use (shames you for asking, changes subject, refuses to share results/proof).</li>
            <li>Casual mentions of high-risk history: Lots of recent hookups/one-night stands without consistent
                protection, high body count with no regular testing between, past STIs without clear "cured and
                retested" follow-up.</li>
            <li>Pushes hard for raw/unprotected sex early ("I'm clean," "don't like condoms," "no need to test") or
                downplays risks.</li>
            <li>Disdain or refusal for barriers/condoms (or removes them mid-act without discussion).</li>
            <li>Signs of ongoing risky lifestyle: Frequent partying/clubbing with hookups, substance use during sex
                (impairs judgment), or mentions "learning experiences" from past infections casually.</li>
            <li>Dodges concurrency questions (multiple partners at once) or gets mad at basic health convos.</li>
            <li>Rushes escalation to sex without any mutual health talk/testing agreement.</li>
            <li><strong>Quick rule of thumb:</strong> If she's responsible about her sexual health (tests regularly,
                communicates openly, respects protection boundaries), that's higher-value alignment with your frame
                anyway. Evasion + pressure = massive risk > short-term win.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And as a conclusion - yes I wanted to penetrate the Game. Yes I will penetrate the game and be the best PUA
            in the world. And yes. By any means necessary. Both guilt and shame were just smoke screens and years of
            programming by feminism and fucking social media.</p>

        <p>And you know what, everyone is disposable. That is just the reality of what is rather than what should be.

        <h2>
            Subject: The power of self talk and affirmations.
        </h2>
        <p>
            So two days ago, maybe three, I had one of the best days in a long time: 6 approaches in less than 3
            hours. Yes, six. They were all gorgeous — group sets and cashiers I like. For some reason, all the girls,
            despite rejection, were nice to me. No meanies. Which I genuinely appreciate. I even approached a hot
            Asian girl who was with her girlfriend. And just as I spoke to her, she told me, “This is my gf,” while
            her girlfriend didn’t mind me at all. I apologized and then left. At first, I didn’t give it much
            importance, thinking it wasn’t necessary, but I had done my power attitudes and positive self-talk
            rehearsal before leaving.
        </p>

        <p>
            A few days later — yesterday, today — I skipped the power attitudes and mindset rehearsal. I also got
            sloppy, I’m not gonna lie. I was terrified of this momentum. I was terrified of getting a huge streak
            and crashing and burning again. Beginner-day rejections come back to haunt me more than anything. I also
            tried to avoid the three-second rule (approaching a girl within the first three seconds of seeing her —
            credit to Mystery), thinking that approach shouldn’t be forced and should feel natural. But I’m in the
            learning phase, and in this phase, I should force it until it becomes natural. Like I always say:
            there’s no such thing as a natural PUA.
        </p>

        <p>
            To counter the fear and past rejection, I used an NLP technique where I take my present self back to the
            day a rejection stung the most, then dissociate from the memory — making it small, black and white, and
            very distant. This exercise works (from experience), but it takes many reps before the memory and the
            person associated with it become irrelevant in my mind. One insight that really stuck with me: one of my
            ex-girlfriend’s young nephews told her in front of me, “Everything that I do is rehearsed and practiced
            a thousand times, that I am a skilled actor deceiving her and everyone.” That line hit hard —
            reinforcing that skilled social performance is **practice, not natural talent**.

        <h2>
            Subject: The Price of Penetrating the Game – Crossing Ex-Girlfriend with New BF While Shitting My Pants Due
            to Approach Anxiety
        </h2>

        <p>
            A few months following the breakup (my first actual win from Game), I was just cold approaching and
            improvising, believing that “fortune favors the brave.” It did favor me that day. But at what price?
            Following the breakup I had it again — crippling anxiety that only got worse after reading <em>The
                Game</em>. I was already approaching before the book, yes — but I wanted to become good at it. I wanted
            more control than just going out nervous and leaving it up to chance.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fast forward: I read the book and started going out every day. Crippled with fear. Crippled with anxiety.
            Adrenaline high and stomach knots literally every thirty seconds. I still remember those vivid memories like
            it was an hour ago. It was a long, disappointing summer. For some reason, I still forced myself out of the
            house every day and tried — or half-assed — approaches.
        </p>

        <p>
            One day I’m at the clothing store and I see my ex-girlfriend with her new boyfriend, smiling, looking at
            Men’s underwear. I’m not gonna lie — I didn’t feel jealous. But I was thinking: she’s beautiful, she loved
            me, wanted to spend time with me, kept texting me 24/7. Even after our last argument she apologised and I
            could’ve still dated her (I was petty and broke up anyway). Not even 3 seconds into seeing her with her new
            man, my amygdala triggered full flight response. I walked away as fast as I could from the scene. I was
            ecstatic.
        </p>

        <p>
            Was this the price of penetrating the game? For not settling? Crippling anxiety for months before my first
            real approach? A mountain of limiting beliefs and hundreds of hours spinning in circles before I even open?
            The book was the best thing I’ve ever read - yes the best thing I've ever read - 
            Yet I paid the harsh price of reading it: extreme self-consciousness.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the main things about reading the book — especially since I was already a cold approacher before —
            was the growing obsession with Game. It made me obsessed with this seductive title: <strong>PENETRATING THE
                GAME</strong>. And as Mystery said (not word for word, but I remember this exact idea): “You’re a PUA
            now, you’ve tasted the forbidden apple of knowledge, there’s no going back.”
