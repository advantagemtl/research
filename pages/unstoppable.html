        <h1>UNSTOPPABLE</h1>

        <p>Happiness is a universal goal, but again, the actions required to achieve it often require us to delay temporary gratification and avoid quick fixes</p>
        <p>A sales process is like a recipe. If you don’t have one, you’re not going to be successful in preparing a dish</p>
        <p>All success skills are learnable</p>
        <p>Your destiny is in your own hands, you can learn any skill you need to learn.</p>
        <p>Your initial environment is extremely important, but it does not determine your future.</p>

        <h2>Self-Concept</h2>
        <p>The self-concept is central here : The way you think about yourself, feel about yourself,you will always perform consistently  with the person you think you are on the inside.</p>
        <p>The starting point of all performance change is to change your self-concept</p>
        <p>Your self-concept is initially formed by the way your parents treat you. Whenever you see an unhappy or dysfunctional adult, you see a bad childhood.</p>
        <p>Nothing from your past can have any influence over you except the influence that you allow it to have.</p>
        <p>You can do anything you put your mind to.</p>

        <p>The people closest to you, especially your family, have the greatest power of suggestion or influence. Then there are your coworkers, your boss, and society as a whole. Even people in your peer group will often try to tear you down when you’re trying to be successful or do something extraordinary.</p>
        <p>Society often seems to demotivate us. The media work on the premise that bad news and crisis sell : if it bleeds , it leads.</p>
        <p>If you do not have a clear sense of yourself, a clear center, you can be easily influenced by all the negative things you hear.</p>
        <p>We have more choices. Of course we have a lot of problems, but one of my great rules is, never worry about things you can’t do anything about</p>

        <h2>Negative Emotions & Responsibility</h2>
        <p>Negative emotions come down to anger, whether they are expressed inwardly or outwardly , those feelings of anger come down in turn to one thing : blame, <span class="highlight">BLAME</span> is the essential reason for all negative emotions, if you stop blaming, negative emotions will stop.</p>
        <p>How do you stop blaming, it’s very simple, you simply accept responsibility by saying the magic words : I AM RESPONSIBLE, I AM RESPONSIBLE , I AM RESPONSIBLE, I AM RESPONSIBLE, you instantly stop all negative emotions, because you cannot accept responsibility and be negative at the same time.</p>
        <p>Develop a habit of accepting responsibility for any difficulty in your life - of which there will be an endless number - and then take action and do whatever you can. If something happens to your family, ask : “I am responsible, what actions can I take?” then take those actions.</p>
        <p>The best cure for worry is continuous action in the direction of your goal.</p>

        <p>Many great ideas are stillborn, they are never given birth because of a lack of motivation, there are people that have a certain level of creativity and ability, but they never give birth to it.</p>
        <p>The only thing that separates out the successful ones is the motivation to get it done.</p>
        <p>The most ruinous of all actions that human beings can take, is destructive criticism. Destructive criticism triggers anger and negativity in the recipient, i call it mental cancer. When this kind of person has an experience or an opportunity, their very first automatic reaction is “wouldn’t that be great!” and the second is : “But I can’t, I can’t because….” they trot out the old reasons : “I don’t have time, I don’t have enough money. I’m not well educated. I’m just too tired at the end of the day. They go on automatically. They stomp out the fire of motivation before it even gets going.</p>

        <h2>Three Reasons People Do Not Accomplish Things</h2>
        <p>There are three reasons why people do not accomplish things today :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Comfort zone. The comfort zone is the greatest enemy of success today. People may fight to get into a comfort zone, or they may get into it gradually or unknowingly. But then they fight like terriers to stay there, even when they know it’s not a good place to be.<br>The thing is, leaders were always conscious of slipping into a comfort zone. They kept themselves out of the comfort zone by setting such big goals for themselves that it was impossible for them to achieve them at their current level of activity. They would have to move out of their comfort zone to accomplish these huge goals at their current level of activity they would have to move out of their comfort zone to accomplish these huge goals</li>
            <li>Fear of failure : the second reason people don’t accomplish things is fear of failure, fear of failure is characterized by the words : “I can’t. I can’t. I’d like to do it, but I can’t, because…..” successful people turn it around and say : “I can do anything I put my mind to.  The only question is how? Where can I learn how? I’ll get a book, I’ll talk to somebody. I’ll go online. “ It never occurs to them that they can’t do something.</li>
            <li>Not knowing how :  if you don’t know how. Look for it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Those are the three reasons : people become too comfortable; they have natural fears, which come from destructive criticism in childhood and perhaps early failure; and they’re ignorant; or they don’t know how.</p>

        <p>Successful people stop and think, sometimes for a long time. Fast people decisions are invariably wrong people decisions</p>
        <p>Whenever you have to make a decision with futurity - take a lot of time to think, take a day, take a weekend.</p>
        <p>Decide your most important task. Start on that task first.</p>

        <p>What drives people. The answer was forward motion, progress, the feeling I’m getting better at my job, and making progress in my career. I am earning more money. I’m doing more of the things I want to do, this feeling of forward movement is the greatest motivator of all. And it’s totally under the individual’s control.</p>

        <p>Motivation requires a motive : Often people are not motivated because they have no motive. They have no WHY</p>

        <p>-True motivation comes from an enhanced feeling of competence. The speaker gives you specific ways to achieve your goals faster and have a better life, that’s what motivates people, because when they learn new skills or ideas. They say, I can do that, that’s not complicated, that’s very practical, and I can see the results I can get.</p>
        <p>People are not motivated unless they can create an exciting visual picture for themselves and think, I can do that, I can get up a little earlier.</p>
        <p>One mentor always said : “I always get up before 6:00AM, if I go to bed late, I still force myself to get up before 6am. That teaches me not to go to bed late the second night in a row.</p>
        <p>The way you do that is by having something to get yourself out of bed for in the morning.</p>

        <h2>Self-Concept Parts</h2>
        <p>Your self concept is made up of three parts.</p>
        <p>The first is your self-ideal : the person you would like to ideally be, it’s your fantasy person, in terms of health, wealth, position, influence, and everything else, this idea is either clear, as it is in the minds of successful people, or unclear. Unsuccessful people are vague and unclear where they would like to be in the future.</p>
        <p>If you could have a magic wand and make your life perfect three years from now, what would it look like, and how would it be different, what would it look like, what would it look like, how would it be different from today.</p>
        <p>The third factor is self-esteem, self-esteem is best defined as how much you like, love, value and appreciate yourself as an important and worthwhile person. This is the reactor core, this is the heart-beat, the critical determinant of your personality. It determines your self-image. As you move from your image of where you are toward your ideal of where you want to be, your self-esteem goes up, you like yourself more, you feel good about yourself, and you feel happy and exuberant.</p>

        <p>The three parts of the self concept :</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Your ideal self : The person you would really like to be</li>
            <li>Your self image : the way you see yourself, the way others see you, the way you think others see you</li>
            <li>Your self-esteem : How much you like, love, value and appreciate yourself.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="quote">
            The two most important pillars of your mental temple are : I like myself and I am responsible. The more you like yourself, the more powerful you feel, the more you like yourself.
        </div>

        <p>Somebody can always do something to take advantage of the current market situation. But it requires ambition, hard work, persistence, tenacity, and bouncing back over and over.</p>
        <p>Recent psychological studies say it all comes down to grit. A person who has grit, determination, and tenacity will not be stopped.</p>
        <p>Poor is a state of mind, Broke is a temporary condition, and I will be back.</p>
        <p>Ninety percent of all successful Americans started with nothing. And they have achieved something worthwhile through years of hard work.</p>
        <p>Behind every lucky person, there’s a long history of hard work and countless failures.</p>
        <p>Statistically, successful people fail vastly more often than the average person.</p>
        <p>So while everybody was outside socialising, I began spending thousands of hours studying. I’d sit at home hour after hour, reading about success. That’s when I learned the importance of eliminating negative emotions. If you do, they’re automatically replaced by positive emotions.</p>
        <p>Often motivation must be renewed or restored on a daily basis.</p>
        <p>Earned success is the foundational principle for self-esteem, self-reliance, self-responsibility, happiness, joy and energy.</p>
        <p>Pick one goal that’s really important to you, then put your whole heart into achieving it, no matter how long it takes. Once you do that, you’ll become a different person, and a better person, for the rest of your life.</p>

        <p>If the idea was, if I want to, I can; I just have to have an intense, burning desire, no: that is just the start, after looking at the map and determining your destination, you need to move toward it.</p>
        <p>One of my favourite lines is : “Pray and move your feet” . It means be really clear about your goal, write it down, then act.</p>
        <p>Any big goal has to be broken down into steps - perhaps twenty, thirty or forty. Then you take one step at a time.</p>
        <p>Many people work for a long time and don’t see a lot of progress, yet they hang in there, and then suddenly everything starts to work for them.</p>
        <p>The thing is to start by taking one step at a time.</p>
        <p>Moving step-by-step towards something that’s important to you gives you a continuous feedback of motivation, a continuous source of energy. This mere act of forward motion makes you smarter or more creative</p>

        <p>As you move toward your goal, motivation increases. Almost everything depends upon your belief, if you are certain that you’re going to achieve this goal sooner or later, nothing will stop you, each time you take a step toward the goal, your belief grows. It grows from zero belief or even negative belief.</p>
        <p>You can’t start with disbelief, you say, I want to become wealthy, but you don’t believe it, you can say I can become wealthy by setting goals. I’m going to start to work everyday. As you keep taking steps, the disbelief begins to dwindle until you reach a psychologically neutral point : you neither believe or disbelieve, if you keep on, you start to believe a little bit more, you keep doing more things,and your belief starts to grow and grow.</p>
        <p>Nothing can stop you  from your goal, because you absolutely, 100 percent, believe that it’s attainable for you, and that becomes true.</p>

        <p>Each person has a success mechanism and a failure mechanism.</p>
        <p>The failure mechanism goes off automatically, which is why 80 percent of the population is mediocre, stuck in the middle, and worried about money all the time.</p>
        <p>The success mechanism has to be triggered, and it’s triggered by a goal,the success mechanism has to be triggered, and it’s triggered by a goal. If you set a goal,the success mechanism becomes the default and shuts off the failure mechanism by overriding it with a goal. As long as you're working on the goal, the failure mechanism never comes on again.</p>

        <p>Everything you do is a result of what’s been programmed into your subconscious, your beliefs are the primary drivers of motivation.</p>
        <p>You do not believe what you see; you see what you already believe.</p>
        <p>All beliefs are learned, your beliefs about yourself, which believe what you think, feel or do, are learned from early childhood. Some people are taught positive beliefs, some people are taught negative beliefs.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately many people have beliefs that are simply not true.</p>
        <p>The starting point of changing your life is to change your beliefs.</p>

        <h2>Self-Limiting Beliefs</h2>
        <p>The most hindering beliefs are self-limiting beliefs : you’re limited in intelligence because you didn’t get great grades. You’re limited in ability, because you did not perform at an excellent level. You're limited in creativity, because you haven't come up with any good ideas. You’re limited in athletic ability, artistic ability and so on.</p>
        <p>One casual negative remark from someone who you think knows what they’re talking about can set you off-course for life. It can come from a casual remark from one of your parents.</p>
        <p>The starting point is to challenge self limiting beliefs and ask yourself, in what area do I feel limited? I started off with no education, no money, no schooling so I had a lot of self limiting beliefs, then I began to think that they weren't true.</p>
        <p>It was a real shock, somebody will tell you something that you believed your whole life, when you find out it’s not true, it’s an amazing revelation.</p>
        <p>Challenge self-limiting beliefs : the starting point is to challenge self-limiting beliefs, ask yourself : In what area do I feel limited? I started off with no education, no money, no schooling, so I had a lot of self-limiting beliefs. Then I began to think they weren’t true. It was all a real shock, somebody will tell you something that you believed all your life, when you find out it’s not true, it’s an amazing revelation.</p>

        <p>The first guy sat there and realized that he had bought his father’s beliefs that he was only suited to be a laborer. Then he saw somebody who was no smarter or better than him, but who had a great life.</p>
        <p>He got up, threw the shovel in the ditch, and quit. He got a job in sales and six years later, he was a millionaire with his own business. He said : “I have been sold a false belief that I’m going to be a laborer my whole life”</p>
        <p>We all have false beliefs that hold us back, they act like brakes to our potential.</p>

        <p>How would you like to earn five to ten times as much? You’re capable of it, how do we know? Because there are lots of people selling the same product in the same market but who are earning five and ten times as much as you. They’re no smarter than you some of them are dumber and less educated than you</p>
        <p>Say : “I can earn all the money that I want simply by continually upgrading my skills and applying myself diligently. Using my time well. And working hard. I can earn the same kind of money  that other people do doing the same things.</p>
        <p>Then you act. If you act as if you already believe you are meant to be a big success, then you start to feel and believe it. The action will create the feeling, just the feeling creates the action.</p>
        <p>If you want to be self-confident, act as if you already are self-confident.</p>
        <p>This is how to eliminate self limiting beliefs : challenge them and do the opposite.</p>

        <p>What if I had all the self-confidence in the world? What if I were not afraid of anything? How would I behave? I would get up early in the morning and knock on every door and ring every telephone, visit every customer, as if I were desperate to see as many people as possible. If you do that, surprise - you develop the same level of confidence as a person who is already extraordinarily successful.</p>

        <p>It says that for every effect, there is a cause or causes. If you duplicate them, you achieve the same effect.</p>
        <p>Ask people who are earning as much as you are doing that’s different from what you’re doing. Whatever they tell you, do it without question.</p>
        <p>If you want to do anything. You do the cause, and the effect will follow.</p>

        <p>The second principle is the law of belief : whatever you believe with feeling, with conviction, becomes your reality. The intensity of your beliefs creates reality.</p>
        <p>The law of expectations says : whatever you expect with confidence becomes your own self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
        <p>Bosses with high expectations build high peak environments. The boss expects people to do well and believes they can do so.</p>
        <p>The fourth area of expectation is yourself, you can never be greater or more successful on the outside than you expect to be on the inside.</p>

        <p>Imagine that you could buy an operating program that you could slide into your brain, which would operate on it for the rest of your life. What would be the best program to buy? Buy the one that says you are going to be a great success. Program that into your brain so that no matter what happens you expect to succeed, to learn , to benefit, to prosper.</p>

        <p>Many people lose their fortunes, even billions of dollars, two or three years later they’re back. What happened? Their belief was solid, their mental set was more powerful than all the facts in the world.</p>
        <p>Attitude is the most important word in the language.</p>
        <p>If you expect to be successful, to be liked, and to learn something from every setback, your attitude is going to be positive, which is the foundation for success.</p>

        <p>Act as if : IF X were true how would I behave</p>
        <p>Say : “I want to purely have positive beliefs. I want to have a belief that I am destined to be a great success in life. If that were true how would I behave?”</p>
        <p>Act as if you were already the person that you desire to be.</p>
        <p>These actions will create feelings. The feelings will create the actions, which in turn will create the results</p>

        <p>You get rid of self limiting beliefs by replacing them with positive, life-enhancing beliefs. You may say : “I don’t believe in myself “ or “I’m not smart enough” or “attractive enough” those are negative beliefs.</p>
        <p>The positive belief is : “I have more brainpower than I could ever use in my lifetime, it’s just a matter of getting it out. I have the same unlimited ability to succeed that anybody else has. I’m an attractive and popular person. That’s the belief that I choose to have” then act as if you already had that belief. It wears down the old belief.</p>

        <p>When you have success, replay it in your mind. Before every event of importance, every person creates a visual picture of how they’re going to perform.</p>
        <p>The person you see is the person you’ll be.</p>
        <p>Athletes and performers do this all the time. Before they go on stage, they create a visual picture of themselves performing at their best, we call this conditioning.</p>
        <p>Sitting quietly in a chair or lying in bed, they visualize themselves performing their sport perfectly</p>
        <p>You become what you think most of the time. If you think about yourself in positive uplifting terms, that becomes your reality.</p>

        <p>The flip side of positive expectations is fear of rejection.</p>
        <p>Most people drop out of sales not because of lack of success, but because they cannot take rejection. Rejection comes because they expect to be rejected.</p>
        <p>No, this next person is going to buy from me, because this is a good deal, and they need it, and it will really help them - it transformed his behavior. It wasn’t the product, it wasn’t the customer, it wasn’t the market. It was he himself who had this doubt, which came from the earlier rejection.</p>

        <p>The way to build positive beliefs is by doing it. If you want to climb a mountain, climb one, for the rest of your life, you can say , “I climbed that mountain. Yes I climb high mountains” for the rest of your life, you believe with 100 percent confidence that you can do it.</p>

        <p>There’s only one thing in the world that you can control, and that’s your thinking . If you think about what you want, if you think about yourself as the best person you can be, and if you think about success and achievement, you will behave and perform accordingly.</p>
        <p>If I believe something strongly enough and back it up with work, it becomes my reality. It becomes the truth for me, and it replaces all negative beliefs from the past.</p>

        <p>Everyone has one big negative belief that holds them back more than anything else. Everyone has one big negative emotion, belief or idea, which is based on a previous experience or something that someone said. Usually it’s unclear.</p>
        <p>Sometimes it takes a long time for  a person to reach the point of clarity and courage where they can tell the therapist , “This is my problem. This is what happened to me, this is how I reacted”.</p>
        <p>Ask yourself, what is the one big negative idea or experience that’s affecting my beliefs ?”</p>
        <p>Until you can identify that one big negative belief or experience that’s holding you back, you’re locked in place, suddenly you’re free, and it’s gone forever.</p>

        <p>Learned helplessness is a major reason why people don’t succeed.</p>
        <p>They have not succeeded in the past, so they assume that, as Shakespeare said “the past is prologue” they believe that what has happened in the past is what’s going to happen in the future, so they lose their enthusiasm for goals.</p>
        <p>Many people don’t have goals, they have wishes. A wish is a goal with no energy behind it.</p>

        <p>There are wealthy people who : struggled, strived, sweated, and finally broke through.</p>
        <p>Goals give you a track to run on, they give you a sense of direction, of clarity. They enable you to concentrate your energies and accomplish more in a year or two than many people do in five or ten years. If you write down your goals and make plans to carry them out, you’ll be astonished at how much more you accomplish and how fast.</p>

        <h2>Goal Setting</h2>
        <p>Decide what you want, be specific : sit down with a piece of paper  decide exactly what you wanna have in life without  limitations, imagine that you can have whatever you write down, the only limit is what you write down</p>
        <p>Be specific, your goal should be so clear and specific that a six year old child could understand it.</p>
        <p>Write down your goal where you can review it everyday. A goal that is not in writing is only a fantasy; it’s a wish, an illusion.</p>
        <p>A number of studies  have examined that students who take notes during class are vastly more successful than students who take no notes. When you’re writing things down, you’re transferring the written goal to your subconscious mind. Your subconscious mind is going to work before you even get up. It works 24 hours a day to bring that goal into life.</p>

        <p>Successful people do what lies clearly at hand, do the most important thing now. They get it done. They get on with it. Unsuccessful people have excuses to procrastinate.</p>
        <p>Only action is action. Not talk, not wish, not hope, not intention. Only action is action.</p>

        <p>Make a list of everything that you could possibly do to achieve the goal, there's something about writing down every step that transforms your thinking.</p>
        <p>What would I need to do to double my income?</p>
        <p>I need to upgrade my skills in this area, or I need to read this book or go on this course. These are the things I’d need to do everyday if I wanted to upgrade my knowledge and skills to achieve my goal.</p>

        <p>You organize your list into a plan by creating a check-list. Checklists are one of the great miracles of modern success.</p>
        <p>People who use them accomplish five or ten times as much as people who don’t.</p>

        <p>If you want to sell your business, the first thing to do is get a book on how to sell a business. If you want to double your sales, get a book on how to increase your sales. If you want to manage your time better, get a book on that subject.</p>

        <p>Take the first step, you’re moving forward, you're gaining speed and moving faster.</p>
        <p>All success comes from making the first step.</p>
        <p>Yet taking the first step is the hardest thing of all.</p>

        <p>Step number seven of goal setting is , do something everyday on your major goal, do something every day, whether it's small or large to move toward your goal. Read something, learn something, do something, but everyday keep the plate spinning, keep the momentum going,  keep moving.</p>
        <p>The momentum principle of success also says that if you stop moving towards your goal, it’s hard to start moving again.</p>
        <p>One of the greatest principles of success is : continuous motion.</p>

        <p>Take a clean sheet of paper and write down ten goals that you would like to accomplish in the next twelve months. Twelve month goals are more powerful than two- or five or ten year goals.</p>

        <p>Your subconscious mind is like a child: it’s simple, innocent, and can only accept commands that are very simple.</p>
        <p>Write down ten goals writing the Three Ps : Positive - Present - personal, the first p is personal, so you always begin with a goal with the word I, I earn, I achieve, I sell , I drive, I live in. Whatever the goal is. It’s I plus an action verb, that’s what activates your subconscious mind and starts it to work like an engine.</p>
        <p>Step number two is to make it positive, never say I stop smoking, I quit smoking, I stop doing this, or I lose this number of pounds, always say, I weigh this number of pounds and so one.</p>
        <p>Step number two three is to state your goal in the present tense, because your subconscious mind cannot process a command unless it’s in the present tense. So you can say I earn this amount of money and then write by this date.</p>
        <p>Your subconscious mind loves time and pressure.</p>
        <p>It goes to work twenty four hours a day to move you toward the goal and attract it to you.</p>
        <p>“The goals started to materialize almost as I started writing”</p>
        <p>A person wants to have a big house, but what would enable them to have a big house? A certain level of income. You say, “I earn this amount of money so that I can have this house.”</p>

        <p>Start off with the one goal that would have the  biggest positive impact on all of your goals, put a circle around that, then take a clean sheet of paper and write it down, positive, present tense, personal : I achieved this goal, by this date. Then make a list of everything you can do to achieve that one goal.</p>

        <p>Accepting responsibility is the starting point of becoming an adult.</p>
        <p>Ninety five percent of actors and actresses are unemployed at any given time. To get a job is a tremendous break, you must know the right people, you must be in the right time at the right place, you must take hundreds of bits and pieces and be discovered to get a slightly bigger part. You must play that part so well that you’re given a supporting role.</p>

        <p>I succeeded, and I succeeded based on my own hard efforts. I succeeded in competition with thousands of other people, and I want to compete.</p>
        <p>I’ve met entrepreneurs who are billionaires and multi-billionaires. All they think about is the next business,the next opportunity, the next product, the next service. They don’t fall apart and drink.</p>
        <p>The thing that keeps you going is having something to look forward to. This is the most important thing in life. Without it. People lose hope.</p>

        <p>One way to turn up the volume on your self-esteem is simply to repeat “I like Myself”  enthusiastically and with conviction. “I like myself, and I love my work. I like myself; I love my work</p>

        <p>Positive self-talk, or affirmations, is extraordinarily powerful.</p>
        <p>The average person speaks to themselves in an inner dialogue of about 1500 words per minute. It flows like a fast moving river. If you are not careful, that inner dialogue will be negative.</p>
        <p>The default setting in every human brain is to think about their worries and pains. You have to click the default setting off by talking to yourself by talking to yourself about who you want to be and what you want to accomplish. Step into the dialogue, deliberately stop it, and speak positively to yourself.</p>

        <h2>Seven Steps to Success</h2>
        <p>Seven steps to success :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Get up every morning an hour early and read to upgrade your skills, wealthy people read one or two hours every day. Poor people don’t read at all, except maybe newspapers.</li>
            <li>Write down your goals every single day in a spiral notebook, everyday, without looking at the previous page, rewrite your major goals to reprogram them into your mind.</li>
            <li>Plan everyday in advance, you’ll increase your productivity 25 percent by simply making a list of everything you need to do before you start.</li>
            <li>Focus and concentrate on your most important task.  You’ll increase your productivity by 50-100 percent by starting and completing your most important task first thing everyday. It’s one of the greatest success principles in history.</li>
            <li>After every single event of importance, do an after-action report, what did I do right? What would I do differently? If you do that and capture your experience on paper, you’ll increase your learning speed by about five or ten times. When you write down your answers, you program them into your subconscious mind. And they become part of your permanent operating system.</li>
            <li>Listen to audio programs all the time you can. You can now have hundreds of hours of the best audio learning in the world. Instead of listening to music, turn driving time into learning time. Turn your car into university on wheels. Never stop taking in new information.</li>
            <li>Treat everyone you meet as though they’re the most important person in the world. Treat them with grace, respect, pleasantness, cordiality, geniality, and courtesy. Be nice to people.. The most successful people in the world are described by others as nice people. Just do that, and every door of opportunity will open up to you.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Taking action towards your goals is the single most important quality of all. The world is full of talented people with fantasies, but they don’t act. They always have an excuse not not to do it yet.</p>

        <p>When you take action, three things happen :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You get immediate feedback from  your actions, which enable you to change course and direction.</li>
            <li>You get ideas for more actions to move ahead faster.</li>
            <li>Your self-confidence and self-esteem go up.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You get all three of those benefits from taking action, and you get nothing from sitting there on the couch.</p>

        <p>Nothing works, at least not for the first time.</p>
        <p>When you take action toward a goal, be assured that it’s not going to work at first.</p>
        <p>The only thing that matters is : does it work; is it getting you the results that you expected? People can fall in love with a course of action even before it’s worked.</p>
        <p>The critical thing is to act and then get feedback. Get an idea, act, fail fast, learn quickly. And try it again. It’s an endless cycle.</p>
        <p>It’s called the doom loop : “Keep making mistakes and learning lessons”</p>
        <p>Every successful person has made an enormous number of mistakes.</p>
        <p>Try, learn, change, try learn change, Ego, learn helplessness, and the comfort zone are all fighting against us, so we often try something and give up if it doesn’t work :”It must have been the wrong idea.” no, try it again. Keep adjusting. This is why flexibility is so important.</p>

        <p>As Charles Darwin observed. :”Survival goes not necessarily to the strongest or the most intelligent of the species, but to the ones adaptable to change.</p>

        <p>How do you know you need to be flexible, you need to adapt and change your course of action? The answer is, it’s not working.</p>
        <p>You’re not getting the results that you expected. Back to the drawing board.</p>
        <p>“No those weren’t failures” they said, “Those were just learning experiences, we never fail. We just learn things.”</p>
        <p>Some of those experiences were expensive and painful, but leaders always look at a situation that way.</p>

        <p>To go back to the bamboo tree, the roots are the unshakable belief that you are going to be successful sooner or later. And that this is just a short-term setback. Whatever’s happening to you, if it’s not working out, that’s fine. Take a deep breath, step back, and do something else.</p>

        <p>When starting a business first thing to do is sit down and ask :</p>
        <p>“What do we believe in? What are our fundamental values? What are the unshakable principles that we’re going to work by?”</p>

        <p>You should be current with everything that’s going on in your field</p>
        <p>“If you're not continually learning and growing in the world today, you’re not going to have a chance in the future.”</p>
        <p>Warren Buffet and Carlos Slim are two of the richest men in the world and they spend 80% of their time reading.</p>
        <p>If you don’t keep upgrading your skills, you’re going to fall behind.</p>

        <p>One of the most important qualities of success is resilience and the ability to bounce back.</p>
        <p>You are only as free as your well-developed options. If you have only one choice , if there’s only one job you can do, you’re trapped. If something changes and you lose a job or your skill becomes obsolete, you may go home and not work for two or three years.</p>

        <p>Another thing that’s really important is sleep, the richest people get 9 hours of sleep. And they get up before 6 AM.</p>
        <p>To unleash your power to spring back, get lots of rest. If you do, you can endure almost anything. If you’re tired and irritable, you’re going to overreact, say things you’ll regret, and make decisions that will be very expensive to correct in the future.</p>

        <p>A person begins to become great when they listen to their inner voice.</p>
        <p>Remember : one idea can change your life : but you never know what the idea is, so you must be continually taking in lots of new ideas so that the right one will come to you at the right time.</p>

        <p>Your success, income, promotion, and lifestyle will be determined by the quality of your work. Your job is to get into the top 10 percent  among the best.</p>
        <p>Your goal should be to get in the top 10% in your field.</p>
        <p>What does it take to get to the top 10%? The decision to get there. Nobody can stop you from being in the top 10 percent, from being recognized as a high-quality producer of your product or service.</p>
        <p>It all comes from continual personal development, getting a little bit better every day.</p>

        <p>The one that stopped doing things that weren’t working that well.</p>
        <p>Often the senior executive who got the company into trouble is not capable of getting it out, because there’s too much ego involvement in previous products and decisions.</p>
        <p>Be your own turnaround artist. The key to success is to stop doing things.</p>
        <p>When you get overwhelmed in your life, sit down and say, “What do I need to stop doing?” the stop, cut it off now.</p>
        <p>Sales people can even do this with clients that provide them with little in sales or profits. They can cut them, keeping the most profitable 20 percent.</p>

        <p>What am I trying to do? Be clear. The answer is, you’re trying to get business results - meaning that you’re going to earn an excess of profits over all the costs involved.</p>

        <p>How am I trying to do it? Always ask this question when you’re experiencing frustration, resistance, low performance, struggle, stress, anger, or dissatisfaction with your work, stop the clock and ask : “What am I trying to do, and how am I trying to do it?” When people try to do that, they realize that they’ve tried to do something in the same way for five years, and it still hasn’t worked.</p>

        <p>Is there a better way? Could there be a better way that the one we’re using today? (There always is) knowing what we now know, would we know , would we start to do it this way again? What would we do differently? That keeps your mind</p>

        <p>These questions are slapping people in the face. What are we trying to do? How are we going to do it? Is it working? If not, why not? What are our assumptions? What would we do if our assumptions ? What would we do if our assumptions were wrong? What if we had no limitations? What if we had an unlimited budget and we could do anything we wanted? What would we do differently if they were to come in and shoot us in the head if we hadn’t accomplished the goal in six months? What changes would we make immediately? Put the pressure on, and people come up with incredible ideas?</p>
