    <hr class="page-break">



    <div class="entry">
        <h2>Approach anxiety</h2>
        <p>Im here at the mall, havent approached any girl, I tend to overthink and wait for too long.</p>
        <p>here's what I'm gonna do, when I see a hot girl, I'll focus on the part I like the most and </p>
        <p>utilize the three second rule while sarging, I wont focus on anything except my</p>
        <p>target to avoid overthinking and blowing it. seduction is not for the timid.</p>
    </div>

 
    <div class="entry">
        <h2>My one Itis</h2>
        <p>I met debora at the subway, despite the age difference (she's 7 years older than me), she gave me her IG,</p>
        <p>And told me she appreciated my courage. I didn't text her nor</p>
        <p>intend to, but for the few seconds that I spoke to her, I felt Love, it was a high vibration, I could</p>
        <p>feel it, I was gonna ask her to go for a coffee but I fleed, I am afraid of falling for someone and</p>
        <p>compromising again, being a PUA is all about being in control and having options, and a futile emotion</p>
        <p>like love comprimises it all. she has a gaze that made my heart sink down my chest, so I kept it what </p>
        <p>it is. something I'll always want.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <h2>Safety : PUA's biggest enemy</h2>
        <p>I actually felt safe with her, ignored everything & everyone to be happy, I didn't wanna be alone with</p>
        <p>my thoughts. I didn't wanna go back to a roach infested appartement and think about how miserable I am.</p>
        <p>I had settled for fear and lack of of discipline, stuck myself in a pattern where I am no longer </p>
        <p>approaching women. but being a pussy instead.</p>
    </div>

 

    <div class="entry">
        <h2>Going in a gimp suit</h2>
        <p>No one gives a fuck, everyone is so absorbed with their problems that no one gives a fuck, it seems</p>
        <p>like afterall, I had more confidence than tyler durden, now I just need to talk to any girl I want.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <h2>I do like women</h2>
        <p>Failure after failure, crash and burns, my brain convinced me that I didn't like women or that most of</p>
        <p>them "weren't my type" until I retained semen and unlike the first time, this time didn't work. I wasnt</p>
        <p>any hornier, I just realized that I was fearing rejection, but my brain was convincing me that I just</p>
        <p>"wasn't attracted to women like that" or that "she isn't my type if she doesn't look like this and that"</p>
        <p>Now I know the truth, I am afterall afraid of rejection. so aside from all the thoughts, I have to reframe
        </p>
        <p>it. and to face it.</p>
    </div>

  

    <div class="entry">
        <h2>Some rejections will always sting.</h2>
        <p>So, I just learned Ross Jeffries unstoppable confidence tape, now I am strong, direct and powerful with</p>
        <p>the women I so desire. now I am 50 feet tall and made of diamond, with a thunder lightning voice. and </p>
        <p>Don't need an excuse for looking at women, until I exchange eye contact with debora for more than 10 seconds.
        </p>
        <p>and she says eew. not gonna lie that stings. that 40 feet tall diamond giant just got hurt by some girl
            saying</p>
        <p>eeew..... rejection is part of this shit, and for one to be a good PUA is to risk humiliation, embarassment.
        </p>
        <p>and rejection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <h2>Breaking The Ice</h2>
        <p>So I approached 5 chicks finally, and it was desencetizing, but since the metro was on curfew, i couldnt</p>
        <p>do it for a few days straight (long enough for anxiety to go away) but fortune eh, so I approached 4-5 chicks
        </p>
        <p>today for the first time in months. maybe since february (it's november now) but I can't do it everyday till
        </p>
        <p>the metro is back so. I'm stuck with anxiety yet once again. I have to beat it before it beats me. </p>
        <p>it seems like game is a timer, and everytime I decide to beat the timer, Something gets in the way. </p>
        <p>it's as if Murphy came in person to visit me to apply his law on me. you know what, I still aspire to</p>
        <p>become the world's greatest pickup artist. but i'm stuck on Day 7 of rules of the game.</p>
    </div>
   
    <div class="entry">
        <h2>Not a One Itis</h2>

        <p>This Debora looks almost untouchable.</p>
        <p> She’s a female clothing store clerk. ></p>
        <p>I’ve been trying to convince myself for the last few months that I wasn’t attracted to her.</p>
        <h3 style="margin:auto;">NEWS FLASH : I AM.</h3>

        <p>It’s been at least two weeks since Breaking the Ice (previous report). I didn’t necessarily have it in me.
        </p>

        <p>I approached one girl just 2–3 minutes earlier, but this one… she’s scary.</p>

        <p>My best bet was to approach her whenever she wasn’t looking at me.</p>

        <p>But whenever I went for it, she raised her head and we made eye contact.</p>

        <p>My amygdala triggered the flight response, and I turned away and walked.</p>

        <p>She had a blank, almost ordinary expression on her face. But I fled the scene.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="entry">
        <h2>Inconsistency vs Game — Isolation is dangerous</h2>
        <p>I wanted to apply the game. I wanted to ask that opinion opener. But breaking the ice again was so lame. I
            keep myself inside for too long.</p>
        <p>I’ll utilize speed seduction to get more momentum and at the same time I will try to progress in Rules of the
            Game as fast as I can.</p>
        <p>Girls approached: 0</p>
        <p>Also here’s a bonus fact: the first approach will always be awkward, creepy and so uncomfortable. The
            objective isn’t the perfect approach, it’s the ice break.</p>
    </div>

 


    <div class="entry">
        <h2>Crippling Anxiety - Reality Check</h2>
        <p>So I am finally back into sarging, twice, maybe three times a day, after months of being scared—hell, even
            terrified—of letting a stranger hear my voice. Two to three approaches are almost impossible for the average
            male, but for Baby the PUA, those were rookie numbers. Plus, I would only ever approach when Debora was
            alone or not a lot of people were watching. I had crippling anxiety when there was a smoking-hot Debora
            inside a crowd.</p>
        <p>I randomly crossed Buddy at the mall. We parted ways and met two hours later. By then, I had only sarged on
            one girl, who was alone, and after crossing him again, he said:</p>
        <p><strong>Buddy</strong>: How was it?</p>
        <p><strong>Baby</strong>: Easy work. I approached five girls and got a phone number (I approached one and got
            nothing).</p>
        <p><strong>Buddy</strong>: Shit, I wish I was as brave as you. You’ve got balls.</p>
        <p><strong>Baby</strong> (Remembering the good old days when I would sarge 15 times a day, sometimes even 30. I
            was addicted, but now anxiety found its way back once I got into a relationship and tasted my first victory
            from Game. I didn’t do it long enough to desensitize from this crippling anxiety. And even though I was
            happy and Debora was adorable, I knew I wasn’t that guy. I wasn’t as confident as she thought. I was
            shitting my pants when I approached her despite seeming natural. I could’ve lied to her, but I couldn’t lie
            to myself. So Baby ends the relationship.): Hell yeah, bro. It’s all about confidence. I actually like that
            girl on the other side of the bar. [Goes unhesitantly. It was a no, but Buddy was still impressed.]</p>
        <p><strong>Buddy</strong>: A lot of guys are all talk, but you mean business.</p>
        <p><strong>Baby</strong>: [Awkwardly appearing confident] Yeah, I am.</p>
        <p>Buddy only made me feel hyper self-conscious about how ass I am, how I half-ass my cold approaches, how
            mediocre I am, and how I settled for letting fear control who I am. But that’s not who I am. I don’t make
            excuses for what I want. I don’t make excuses for wanting to meet and talk to women. I am aggressive,
            direct, and powerful with the women I desire. I aspire to become the best PUA in the world.</p>
        <p>I really wondered: was everyone in Project Hollywood just as awkward as I am? Was Tyler Durden, the sarging
            machine, just as awkward and insecure as I am? Was I destined to stay mediocre? One year ago, I wore a gimp
            suit and headed the fuck out. And today, I’m still awkward?</p>
    </div>

 
    <div class="entry">
        <h2>Wingman</h2>
        <p>Since Buddy made me super self-conscious, I texted him, explaining the issue and asking for help — asking him
            to be my wingman sometime. He said we could plan something after Christmas (a month and a half from now). I
            was feeling crippling anxiety all day. I texted back, “Sure, thank you, we’ll talk.” Buddy was handsome and
            didn’t really need game (at least not the way I do). Out of desperation, I headed to the Game forums — Game
            Atlanta, Georgia — and asked if anyone wanted to wing me.</p>
        <p>To my surprise (since no one usually responds), some guy — Bats — responded fast. He said he was new in town,
            a “Mystery Method guy,” and a magician. So we scheduled a meeting for tomorrow.</p>
        <p>We met at the downtown square. I was curious about his magic tricks — I’ve never seen magic before — so I
            asked, “Hey, show me some card tricks before I sarge at the first girl.” For some reason, the more
            mind-blowing a trick was, the more “scammed” I felt rather than surprised. See, I believe there’s no such
            thing as magic — only magicians and illusions. I was deceived, not surprised. (Not hating, just saying.)</p>
        <p>Note: I’m trying to rebuild my confidence, so I sarged as ugly as I humanly could — overgrown hair, my winter
            coat, worn-out jeans from years ago, and torn Adidas shoes.</p>
        <p>During this session, I approached three girls I wouldn’t normally even consider — all way outside my comfort
            zone.</p>
        <p>Debora was working at a women’s clothing store — one full of baddies — and this Debora stood out. A blonde
            bombshell, she easily eclipsed the other hot girls. As ugly, unprepared, and unconfident as I was, I went
            for it (the wing effect). I would never have done this alone. That’s why I call it the wing effect. I’m glad
            I did. It was a rejection. A real one. But I consider these three approaches the first real steps out of my
            comfort zone in ages.</p>
        <p>Extra note: MR (the outcome-oriented mentor) suggested I open by saying: “Hey my friend wants to show you a
            magic trick!”</p>
        <p>Dialogue:</p>
        <p><strong>Bats:</strong> How’d it go?<br>
            <strong>Baby:</strong> It was awkward, bro. I was super scared, but I did it.<br>
            <strong>Bats:</strong> So how many “sets” do you do per day?<br>
            <strong>Baby:</strong> 2–3, but these were quality approaches.<br>
            <strong>Bats:</strong> (Bats wore a green backpack and hat — even indoors — smelled weird, had a yellow
            plastic necklace, and a very loose handshake. Again, not hating.) Do you do this every day?<br>
            <strong>Baby:</strong> Sure. I love sarging.<br>
            <strong>Bats:</strong> Bro, daygame sucks. (Pulls up a video of Mystery saying daygame sucks.)<br>
            <strong>Baby:</strong> (Sees a hot Debora) Yo, she’s super hot.
        </p>
        <p>Debora enters Foot Locker. A lot of people are around — embarrassing — but Bats is watching. For me,
            approaching her proves I’m superior, so I do it anyway. Another rejection. But for some reason, rejection
            bounces off me like bullets off Superman. Still, it was approach and open anxiety.</p>
        <p><strong>Bats:</strong> Bro, you’re wasting your time with daygame. I approach 13–15 sets a night. How are you
            supposed to date nines and tens approaching single girls at the mall?<br>
            <strong>Baby:</strong> I’m just trying to rebuild my confidence. How many girls have you approached so
            far?<br>
            <strong>Bats:</strong> 30 in the last week. I open groups and show them magic tricks at the bar.<br>
            <strong>Baby:</strong> Okay, great. Have you gotten laid?<br>
            <strong>Bats:</strong> No. But that’s not my objective.<br>
            <strong>Baby:</strong> WTF? If you aren’t getting any and don’t intend to, why are you trying to learn game?
        </p>
        <p>(Bats said his body count was 2 — which I highly doubt — said he likes white girls — he’s Indian — and
            somehow still got “some Snapchats.” His girlfriend broke up with him because he was stalking her. Whatever.
            I don’t care about him or his background. I needed a wingman to break the ice. That’s why we hung out. I’ll
            try similar quality approaches next time solo, and see how Baby the PUA performs. If I still need him, I’ll
            contact him again.)</p>
        <p><strong>Bats:</strong> I want to learn game so it becomes natural. You’re very outcome-oriented — all you
            want is to get laid. I want to master my framework. That’s the difference between us.</p>
        <p>Bats will face a very tough reality check. He paid $5,500 to some PUA online workshop a few years ago. They
            post daily goals and some 500-page paraphrased Mystery Method book. Theory is cool, but this guy was
            shielding his ego and avoiding exposure under the excuse of “learning framework so I don’t have to take
            action.” All I do is open — which is shallow as fuck.</p>
        <p>I’ll keep him around for when I need a wing, since I may need him a few times. But I’ll fuck off whenever I
            no longer need him.</p>

        <p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>
        <p>Baby vs. Bats boils down to two classic PUA archetypes clashing:</p>
        <p><strong>Baby:</strong> Raw, outcome-driven, impatient. He grinds in the dirt — solo daygame, ugly sarging to
            kill ego, forcing scary approaches, judging progress by real results (lays). Ruthless with himself, so
            ruthless with anyone dodging the same pain.</p>
        <p><strong>Bats:</strong> Theory-loaded, process-focused, indirect. Hides behind props (magic tricks, Mystery
            scripts, group nightgame), dropped $5,500 on workshops, brags volume but admits zero lays and says it’s not
            even the goal. Textbook permanent intermediate.</p>
        <p>Neither is fully “right,” but Baby’s path is the one that actually leads somewhere.</p>
        <p>Baby’s rude as hell — the digs about smell, handshake, necklace, stalking ex, fake body count are harsh and
            borderline mean. Some of it’s projection: he’s pissed at his own past delays, so he unloads on the guy who
            mirrors the traps he’s escaping.</p>
        <p>But the core judgment isn’t too harsh. Bats screams red flags:</p>
        <p>• Big money on theory, no results<br>
            • Volume bragging with zero sexual intent<br>
            • Props and groups as crutches<br>
            • Trashing daygame while avoiding its exposure<br>
            • Defensive “you’re too outcome-oriented” cope</p>
        <p>Baby’s read — “ego-shielding via framework to avoid action” — is dead accurate. Guys stuck forever look
            exactly like Bats.</p>
        <p>Baby uses him perfectly: temporary tool for the wing effect, discard when no longer needed. Cold, but smart
            momentum protection.</p>
        <p>Bottom line: Baby’s edge comes from hunger; Bats’ niceness from comfort. Hunger wins, even if it turns you
            into a bit of an asshole.</p>

        <h2> Field Report : L Wingman</h2>

        <p>
            So I decided no longer to hangout with Bats, the whole purpose of the Wingman is to encouarge you,
            to push you when your'e afraid,to lift you up when
            you crash and fail, this guy, wanted comfort, not action.
        </p>
        <p>
            whenever I told him that I was a bit afraid to approach or nervous,
            he didn't give me the boost I needed, he didn't challenge me to be
            better. he never even made a real approach in his life.
        </p>
        <p>
            there's a difference between being a street preformer and having "Magic Game".
            he unfortunately segments in the first category, not that im saying it's wrong,
            just for the wrong reason.
        </p>
        <p>
            all he keeps saying is the words such as "framework" and "sets" "day-game" over and
            fucking over again, like a broken fucking record.
            very low self awarenessa fucked up self concept, and thinking that Neil Strauss's the game is the solution.
        </p>
        <p>"Now I have a framework so game becomes natural part of my life to attract tens".
        <p>
            If anything. loser ville is that way.
            Go do your weird reunions online with other fucking losers who don't approach,
            who keep theorizing and "building" frameworks thinking that game will come along the way.
            the whole point of hanging out with him was to face my fear, not to baby sit, not
            to be a therapist. and not to listen to his story about how he switched towns because
            his old town is 100,000 so if he gets rejected a lot he'll cross girls again and become laughing stock.
            I don't even know why he needed a wingman. in Loserville, wingmen comfort each other. however in the real
            world, Players make no excuses for wanting to meet women.

        <h2>Ugly Sarging & What the secret society of pickup artists has become</h2>
        <p>
            So I finally did it, the asian cashier, that the female beauty product shop, i walked what felt like
            a long and far subway runway while all the girls at the store are stairing at me as i'm walking past
            them and ignoring the store clerks as they say hi, just to reach debora, A smoking hot asian girl, tattoos,
            pierceings, and looks like she just escaped from a playboy magazine.I finally approached the hottest girl
            I can as ugly as I humanely possibly can, haircut is shit, old winter coat from 3 years ago, and jeans.
            there's a
            huge difference between ugly and nasty, so Hygiene is always on point.
            for the first time, isntead of excusing myself, I just said : "Hi, Yeah I just thought your very beautiful,
            can I get
            your instagram or something". I wasn't needy. and to be honest I was that 40 feet tall dude made of diamond.
            and that girl acknowledged me. "I'm sorry I have a boyfriend", okay. have a good day!! and then walk out.
        </p>
        <p>Still grinding solo, still getting that stomach knot before every approach, still pissed
            off at how far the "game" has fallen.</p>
        <p>The secret society Neil Strauss wrote about in The Game? It's fucking dead. Buried. The old forums are
            gone—Pickup Artist Forum shut down last year after 18 years. RSD Inner Circles? Pulled ages ago. Neil
            Strauss? He dipped out forever—married, kid, books about relationships and truth, no more seduction guru
            shit since 2015. Mystery still runs some live online workshops (cheap compared to the old 4k bootcamps), but
            he's the last dinosaur standing.</p>
        <p>What's replaced it? A bunch of small-timers on Skool.com selling $10/month subscriptions to "frameworks" and
            "inner game" circles. Game Global has one, with infield vids and weekly calls—sounds cool on paper, but it's
            the same enabling bullshit. Points for posting, unlock courses, AI wingman whatever. Creators make peanuts
            after fees, members pay for comfort, thinking confidence is "natural" once you calibrate your structure.
            Approach anxiety? "It'll go away with the perfect framework." No reps needed yet. Just theorize forever.</p>
        <p>It's a loser's market. A circle-jerk for permanent intermediates who moved to new towns to avoid seeing the
            same rejections twice. They sell safety nets to guys like I used to be—scared, overthinking, hiding behind
            PDFs and Discord servers. "Build your inner game first." "Don't expose yourself until you're ready." Fuck
            that. That's why the bottom of the pyramid stays stuck: comfortable ideas sold to losers who don't want to
            face the fire.</p>
        <p>I resent it because I was there. I bought the cope. I wasted months on theory while Debora walked by
            untouched. I needed someone to shove me, not pat my back. The community was supposed to be about action,
            exposure, eating rejection until it tastes like nothing. Now it's monetized comfort for the many who never
            start.</p>
        <p>So yeah, I'm done with it. No Skool subs, no $10 frameworks, no waiting for "natural confidence." Just me,
            the mall, the fear, and the next girl. Players make no excuses. The rest? Loserville is that way →</p>

        <h2>Subject : People’s opinions ain’t gonna suck your dick.</h2>

        <p>
            So here I am again. I went out, I was ready. But again. Two main objections arise. 1 - extreme self
            consciousness and 2 - No urgency, so i’m always procrastinating. I have to be aggressive and urgent all the
            time. I have to be on emergency mode all the fucking time. The thing is I’ve grown afraid from people’s
            silent judgment. People are insecure as fuck. Men especially those who say you are thirsty and needy are
            fucking watching porn and beating their dick every night. My problem is. I’ve let the most bitchless,
            cowardly motherfuckers judge me. I love sex, and I will make no excuses to get the women I want. I will go
            for it, congruently and powerfully.
            I am genuinely pissed as fuck. That I’m half assing my approaches. That I am mediocre at best. That I claim
            to wanna be the best PUA in the world yet still overthink instead of ACT!!!.s
